<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>When a Bitcoin transaction contains inputs that reference previous
transaction outputs sent to different Bitcoin addresses, personally
identifiable information of the user will leak into the blockchain in an
uncontrolled manner. While undesirable, these transactions are
frequently unavoidable due to the natural fragmentation of wallet
balances over time.</p>
<p>This document proposes a set of best practice guidelines which minimize
the uncontrolled disclosure of personally identifiable information by
defining standard forms for transactions containing heterogenous input
scripts.</p>
<h2 id="Copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is in the public domain.</p>
<h2 id="Definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heterogenous input script transaction (HIT)</strong>: A transaction
containing multiple inputs where the scripts of the previous
transaction outputs being consumed are not identical (e.g. a
transaction spending outputs which were sent to more than one Bitcoin
address)</li>
<li><strong>Unavoidable heterogenous input script transaction</strong>: A HIT created
as a result of a user’s desire to create a new output with a value
larger than the value of his wallet's largest existing unspent output</li>
<li><strong>Intentional heterogenous input script transaction</strong>: A HIT created
as part of a user protection protocol for reducing uncontrolled
disclosure of personally-identifying information (PII)</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this procedure, when input scripts are evaluated for
uniqueness, &quot;input script&quot; should be interpreted to mean, &quot;the script of
the previous output referenced by an input to a transaction&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="Motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>The recommendations in this document are designed to accomplish three
goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maximise the effectiveness of user-protecting protocols: Users may
find that protection protocols are counterproductive if such
transactions have a distinctive fingerprint which renders them
ineffective.</li>
<li>Minimise the adverse consequences of unavoidable heterogenous input
transactions: If unavoidable HITs are indistinguishable from
intentional HITs, a user creating an unavoidable HIT benefits from
ambiguity with respect to graph analysis.</li>
<li>Limiting the effect on UTXO set growth: To date, non-standardized
intentional HITs tend to increase the network's UTXO set with each
transaction; this standard attempts to minimize this effect by
standardizing unavoidable and intentional HITs to limit UTXO set
growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, this specification proposes a set of
best practices for heterogenous input script transaction creation. These
practices accommodate all applicable requirements of both intentional
and unavoidable HITs while maximising the effectiveness of both in terms
of preventing uncontrolled disclosure of PII.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, two forms of HIT are proposed: Standard form
and alternate form.</p>
<h2 id="Interaction_with_Other_Procedures">Interaction with Other Procedures</h2>
<p>Applications which wish to comply both with this procedure and BIP69
should apply this procedure prior to applying BIP69.</p>
<h2 id="Standard_form_heterogenous_input_script_transaction">Standard form heterogenous input script transaction</h2>
<h3 id="Rules">Rules</h3>
<p>A HIT is Standard form if it adheres to all of the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of unique output scripts must be equal to the number of
unique inputs scripts (irrespective of the number of inputs and
outputs).</li>
<li>All output scripts must be unique.</li>
<li>At least one pair of outputs must be of equal value.</li>
<li>The largest output in the transaction is a member of a set
containing at least two identically-sized outputs.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>The requirement for equal numbers of unique input/output scripts instead
of equal number of inputs/outputs accommodates user-protecting UTXO
selection behavior. Wallets may contain spendable outputs with identical
scripts due to intentional or accidental address reuse, or due to
dusting attacks. In order to minimise the adverse consequences of
address reuse, any time a UTXO is included in a transaction as an input,
all UTXOs with the same spending script should also be included in the
transaction.</p>
<p>The requirement that all output scripts are unique prevents address
reuse. Restricting the number of outputs to the number of unique input
scripts prevents this policy from growing the network’s UTXO set. A
standard form HIT transaction will always have a number of inputs
greater than or equal to the number of outputs.</p>
<p>The requirement for at least one pair of outputs in an intentional HIT
to be of equal value results in optimal behavior, and causes intentional
HITs to resemble unavoidable HITs.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate_form_heterogenous_input_script_transactions">Alternate form heterogenous input script transactions</h2>
<p>The formation of a standard form HIT is not possible in the following
cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>The HIT is unavoidable, and the user’s wallet contains an
insufficient number or size of UTXOs to create a standard form HIT.</li>
<li>The user wishes to reduce the number of utxos in their wallet, and
does not have any sets of utxos with identical scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>When one of the following cases exist, a compliant implementation may
create an alternate form HIT by constructing a transaction as follows:</p>
<h3 id="Procedure">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find the smallest combination of inputs whose value is at least the
value of the desired spend.
<ol>
<li>Add these inputs to the transaction.</li>
<li>Add a spend output to the transaction.</li>
<li>Add a change output to the transaction containing the difference
between the current set of inputs and the desired spend.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Repeat step 1 to create a second pair of outputs, where one output
has the same value as the spend output of the previous step.</li>
<li>(optional) Repeat step 2 until the desired number of inputs have
been consumed and/or the desired number outputs have been created.</li>
<li>Adjust the change outputs as necessary to pay the desired
transaction fee.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clients which create intentional HITs must have the capability to form
alternate form HITs, and must do so for a non-zero fraction of the
transactions they create.</p>
<h3 id="Rules-1">Rules</h3>
<p>An HIT formed via the preceding procedure will adhere to the following
conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of unique inputs scripts must exceed the number of output
scripts.</li>
<li>All output scripts must be unique.</li>
<li>At least one pair of outputs must be of equal value.
<ol>
<li>&quot;Standard outputs&quot; refers to the set of outputs with equal value</li>
<li>&quot;Standard value&quot; refers to the value of the standard outputs</li>
<li>&quot;Change outputs&quot; refers to all outputs which are not standard
outputs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For a HIT containing n standard outputs, there must exist at least
one possible way to organize the inputs and outputs into n sets,
where all sets satisfy the following:
<ol>
<li>The set contains one or more inputs, exactly one standard
output, and exactly one change output</li>
<li>An input or output that appears in one set must not appear in
any other set</li>
<li>The sum of the inputs in the set minus the value of the change
output is equal to the standard value with a tolerance equal to
the transaction fee.</li>
<li>Change outputs with a value of zero (virtual change outputs) are
permitted. The are defined for the purpose of testing whether or
not a HIT adheres to this specification but are not present in
the version of the transaction which is broadcast to the
network.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Non-compliant_heterogenous_input_script_transactions">Non-compliant heterogenous input script transactions</h2>
<p>If a user wishes to create an output that is larger than half the total
size of their spendable outputs, or if their inputs are not distributed
in a manner in which the alternate form procedure can be completed, then
the user can not create a transaction which is compliant with this
procedure.</p>
