</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>This document defines an improved variant of Bech32 called <strong>Bech32m</strong>,
and amends BIP173 to use Bech32m for native segregated witness outputs
of version 1 and later. Bech32 remains in use for segregated witness
outputs of version 0.</p>
<h3 id="Copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.</p>
<h3 id="Motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p><a href="/173">BIP173</a> defined a generic checksummed
base 32 encoded format called Bech32. It is in use for segregated
witness outputs of version 0 (P2WPKH and P2WSH, see
<a href="/141">BIP141</a>), and other applications.</p>
<p>Bech32 has an unexpected
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sipa/bech32/issues/51">weakness</a>: whenever the final
character is a 'p', inserting or deleting any number of 'q' characters
immediately preceding it does not invalidate the checksum. This does not
affect existing uses of witness version 0 BIP173 addresses due to their
restriction to two specific lengths, but may affect future uses and/or
other applications using the Bech32 encoding.</p>
<p>This document addresses that by specifying Bech32m, a variant of Bech32
that mitigates this insertion weakness and related issues.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>We first specify the new checksum algorithm, and then document how it
should be used for future Bitcoin addresses.</p>
<h3 id="Bech32m">Bech32m</h3>
<p>Bech32m modifies the checksum of the Bech32 specification, replacing the
constant <em>1</em> that is xored into the checksum at the end with
<em>0x2bc830a3</em>. The resulting checksum verification and creation algorithm
(in Python, cf. the code in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#Bech32%7CBIP173">Bech32
section</a>):</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>BECH32M_CONST = 0x2bc830a3

</span><span>  return [(polymod &gt;&gt; 5 * (5 - i)) &amp; 31 for i in range(6)]
</span></code></pre>
<p>All other aspects of Bech32 remain unchanged, including its
human-readable parts (HRPs).</p>
<p>A combined function to decode both Bech32 and Bech32m simultaneously
could be written using:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>class Encoding(Enum):
</span><span>    BECH32 = 1
</span><span>    BECH32M = 2
</span><span>
</span><span>def bech32_bech32m_verify_checksum(hrp, data):
</span><span>    check = bech32_polymod(bech32_hrp_expand(hrp) + data)
</span><span>    if check == 1:
</span><span>        return Encoding.BECH32
</span><span>    elif check == BECH32M_CONST:
</span><span>        return Encoding.BECH32M
</span><span>    else:
</span><span>        return None
</span></code></pre>
<p>which returns either None for failure, or one of the BECH32 / BECH32M
enumeration values to indicate successful decoding according to the
respective standard.</p>
<h3 id="Addresses_for_segregated_witness_outputs">Addresses for segregated witness outputs</h3>
<p>Version 0 outputs (specifically, P2WPKH and P2WSH addresses) continue to
use Bech32<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> as specified in BIP173. Addresses for segregated witness
outputs version 1 through 16 use Bech32m. Again, all other aspects of
the encoding remain the same, including the 'bc' HRP.</p>
<p>To generate an address for a segregated witness output:</p>
<ul>
<li>If its witness version is 0, encode it using Bech32.</li>
<li>If its witness version is 1 or higher, encode it using Bech32m.</li>
</ul>
<p>To decode an address, client software should either decode with both a
Bech32 and a Bech32m decoder<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, or use a decoder that supports both
simultaneously. In both cases, the address decoder has to verify that
the encoding matches what is expected for the decoded witness version
(Bech32 for version 0, Bech32m for others).</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates the checks that need to be performed.
Refer to the Python code linked in the reference implementation section
below for full details of the called functions.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>def decode(hrp, addr):
</span><span>    hrpgot, data, spec = bech32_decode(addr)
</span><span>    if hrpgot != hrp:

</span><span>    decoded = convertbits(data[1:], 5, 8, False)
</span><span>    # Witness programs are between 2 and 40 bytes in length.
</span><span>    if decoded is None or len(decoded) &lt; 2 or len(decoded) &gt; 40:
</span><span>        return (None, None)
</span><span>    # Witness versions are in range 0..16.

</span><span>        return (None, None)
</span><span>    # Witness v0 programs must be exactly length 20 or 32.
</span><span>    if data[0] == 0 and len(decoded) != 20 and len(decoded) != 32:
</span><span>        return (None, None)
</span><span>    # Witness v0 uses Bech32; v1 through v16 use Bech32m.

</span><span>        return (None, None)
</span><span>    # Success.
</span><span>    return (data[0], decoded)
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Error locating</strong></p>
<p>Bech32m, like Bech32, does support locating<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> the positions of a few
substitution errors. To combine this functionality with the segregated
witness addresses proposed by this document, simply try locating errors
for both Bech32 and Bech32m. If only one finds error locations, report
that one. If both do (which should be very rare), there are a number of
options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report the one that needs fewer corrections (if they differ).</li>
<li>Eliminate the response(s) that are inconsistent. Any symbol that isn't
on an error location can be checked. For example, if the witness
version symbol is not an error location, and it doesn't correspond to
the specification used (0 for Bech32, 1+ for Bech32m), that response
can be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the fancy Javascript decoder below for example of the above.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>This document introduces a new encoding for v1 segregated witness
outputs and higher versions. There should not be any compatibility
issues on the receiver side; no wallets are creating v1 segregated
witness addresses yet, as the output type is not usable on mainnet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bech32m proposal breaks forward-compatibility for
sending to v1 and higher version segregated witness addresses. This
incompatibility is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-October/018236.html">intentional</a>.
An alternative design was
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-November/017460.html">considered</a>
where Bech32 remained in use for certain subsets of future addresses,
but ultimately
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-December/018293.html">discarded</a>.
By introducing a clean break, we protect not only new software but also
existing senders from the mutation issue, as new addresses will be
incompatible with the existing Bech32 address validation.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-November/018268.html">Experiments</a>
by Taproot proponents had shown that hardly any wallets and services
supported sending to higher segregated witness output versions, so
little is lost by
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-December/018298.html">breaking</a>
forward-compatibility. Furthermore, those experiments identified cases
in which segregated witness implementations would have caused wallets to
burn funds when sending to version 1 addresses. In case it is still in
use, the chosen approach will prevent such software from destroying
funds when attempting to send to a Bech32m address.</p>

<h2 id="Test_vectors">Test vectors</h2>
<p><strong>Implementation advice</strong> Experiments testing BIP173 implementations
found that many wallets and services did not support sending to higher
version segregated witness outputs. In anticipation of the proposed
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki">Taproot</a>
soft fork introducing v1 segregated witness outputs on the network, we
emphatically recommend employing the complete set of test vectors
provided below as well as ensuring that your implementation supports
sending to v1 <strong>and higher versions</strong>. All higher versions of native
segregated witness outputs should be recognized as valid recipients. As
higher versions are not defined on the network, no wallet should ever
create them and no recipient should ever provide them to a sender. Nor
should a recipient ever want to falsely provide them as the recipient
would simply see a payment intended to themselves burned instead.
However, by defining higher versions as valid recipients now, future
soft forks introducing higher versions of native segwit outputs will be
forward-compatible to all wallets correctly implementing the Bech32m
specification.</p>

<h2 id="Appendix:_checksum_design_&amp;_properties">Appendix: checksum design &amp; properties</h2>
<p>Checksums are used to detect errors introduced into data during
transfer. A hash function-based checksum such as Base58Check detects any
type of error uniformly, but not all classes of errors are equally
likely to occur in practice. Bech32 prioritizes detection of
substitution errors, but improving detection of one error class
inevitably worsens detection of other error classes. During the design
of Bech32, it was assumed that other simple error patterns beside
substitutions would have a similar detection rate as in a hash
function-based design, and detection would only be worse for complex,
impractical errors. The discovered insertion weakness shows that this is
not the case.</p>
<p>For Bech32m, we aim to retain Bech32's guarantees for substitution
errors, but make sure that other common errors don't perform worse than
a hash function-based checksum would. To make sure the new standard is
easy to implement, we restrict the design space to only amending the
final constant that is xored in, as it was
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-December/017521.html">observed</a>
that that is sufficient to mitigate the 'q' insertion issue while
retaining the intended substitution error detection. In what follows, we
explain how the new constant <em>0x2bc830a3</em> was chosen.</p>
<h3 id="Error_patterns_&amp;_detection_probability">Error patterns &amp; detection probability</h3>
<p>We define an error pattern as a sequence of first one or more deletions,
then swaps of adjacent characters, followed by substitutions,
insertions, and duplications, in that order, all in specific positions,
applied to a string with valid checksum that is otherwise randomly
chosen. For insertions and substitutions we assume a uniformly random
new character. For example, &quot;delete the 17th character, swap the 11th
character with the 12th character, and insert a random character in the
24th position&quot; is an error pattern. &quot;Replace the 43rd through 48th
character with 'aardvark'&quot; is not a valid error pattern, because the new
characters are not random and there is no reason why this particular
string is more likely than any other to be substituted.</p>
<p>A hash function-based checksum design with a 30-bit hash would have a
probability of incorrectly accepting equal to <em>2<sup>-30</sup></em>, for
every error pattern. Bech32 has a probability of 0 to incorrectly accept
error patterns consisting of up to 4 substitutions—they are always
detected. The 'q'-insertion issue shows that for Bech32 a simple error
pattern (&quot;insert a random character in the penultimate position&quot;) with
probability <em>2<sup>-10</sup></em> exists: it requires the final character to
be 'p' (leaving only 1 in 32 strings), and requires the inserted
character to be 'q' (permitting only 1 of 32 possible inserted
characters).</p>
<p>Note that the choice of <em>what</em> the error pattern is (which types of
errors, and where) isn't part of our probabilities: we try to make sure
that <em>every</em> pattern behaves well, not just randomly chosen ones,
because presumably humans make some kinds of errors more than others,
and we cannot easily model which ones.</p>
<h3 id="Detection_properties_of_Bech32m">Detection properties of Bech32m</h3>
<p>The table below shows the error detection properties of Bech32m, and a
comparison with Bech32. The code used for this analysis can be found
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/sipa/14c248c288c3880a3b191f978a34508e#file-const_analysis-cpp">here</a>.
Every row specifies one error pattern via the constraints in the left
four columns. The remaining columns report what percentage of those
patterns have certain probabilities of not being detected. The columns
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>errors</strong> The maximum number of individual errors considered</li>
<li><strong>of type</strong> What type of errors are considered (either &quot;subst. only&quot;
for just substitutions, or &quot;any&quot; to also include deletions, swaps,
insertions, and duplications)</li>
<li><strong>window</strong> The maximum size of the window in which the errors have to
occur<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>code/verifier</strong> Whether this line is about Bech32 or Bech32m encoded
strings, and whether those are evaluated regarding their probability
of being accepted by either a Bech32 or a Bech32m verifier.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>error patterns with failure probability</strong> For each probability (<em>0</em>,
<em>2<sup>-30</sup></em>, <em>2<sup>-25</sup></em>, <em>2<sup>-20</sup></em>,
<em>2<sup>-15</sup></em>, and <em>2<sup>-10</sup></em>) this reports what percentage
of error patterns restricted by the constraints in the previous
columns have those probabilities of being incorrectly accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The properties are divided into two classes: those that hold over all
strings when averaged over all possible HRPs (human readable parts), and
those specific to the &quot;bc1&quot; HRP with the length restrictions imposed by
segregated witness addresses<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>

constants that permit any error pattern of 2 errors or less in a
window of 68 characters or less with a detection probability <em>≥

<li>Reject all constants that do not exhibit the <sup>(c)</sup> properties

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p><strong>Why not permit both Bech32 and Bech32m for v0 addresses?</strong>
Permitting both encodings reduces the error detection capabilities
(it makes it equivalent to only have 29 bits of checksum).</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p><strong>Can a single string simultaneously be valid as Bech32 and
Bech32m?</strong> No, a valid Bech32 and Bech32m string will always differ
by at least 3 characters if they are the same length.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p><strong>What about error correction?</strong> As explained in BIP173,
introducing error correction reduces the ability to detect errors.
While it is technically possible to correct a small number of errors
due to Bech32(m)'s nature as a BCH code, implementations should
refrain from using this for more than indicating where an error may
be present.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="4"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<p><strong>What is an error pattern’s window size?</strong> The window size of an
error pattern is the length of the smallest consecutive range of
characters that contains all modified characters (on input or
output; whichever is larger). For example, an error pattern that
turns &quot;abcdef&quot; into &quot;accdbef&quot; has a window size of 4, as it is
replacing &quot;bcd&quot; with &quot;ccdb&quot;, a 4 character string. Window size is
only meaningful when the pattern consists of two or more errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="5"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">5</sup>
<p><strong>Why do we care about probability of accepting Bech32m strings in
Bech32 verifiers?</strong> For applications where Bech32m replaces an
existing use of Bech32 (such as segregated witness addresses), we
want to make sure that a Bech32m string created by new software
won’t be erroneously accepted by old software that assumes Bech32 -
even when a small number of errors were introduced as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="6"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<p><strong>Should we also take into account failures that occur due to
taking a valid Bech32m string, and after errors it becoming
acceptable to a Bech32 verifier?</strong> This situation may in theory
occur for segregated witness addresses when errors occur that change
the version number in a v1+ address to v0. Due to the specificity of
this type of error, plus the additional constraints that apply for
v0 addresses, this is both unlikely and hard to analyze.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="7"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">7</sup>
<p><strong>What restrictions were taken into account for the &quot;bc1&quot;-specific
analysis?</strong> The minimum length (due to witness programs being at
least 2 bytes), the maximum length (due to witness programs being at
most 40 bytes), and the fact that the witness programs are a
multiple of 8 bits. The fact that the first data symbol cannot be
over 16, or that the padding has to be 0, is not taken into account.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="8"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">8</sup>
<p><strong>How were the properties to select for chosen?</strong> All these
properties are as strong as they can be without rejecting every
constant: rejecting constants with lower probabilities, or more
errors, or wider windows all result in nothing left.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="9"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">9</sup>
<p><strong>Why optimize for segregated witness addresses (with HRP &quot;bc1&quot;)
specifically?</strong> Our analysis for generic HRP has limitations (see
the detailed description
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/sipa/14c248c288c3880a3b191f978a34508e#file-bech32m_mail-txt">here</a>,
under &quot;Technical details&quot;). We optimize for generic usage first, but
optimize for segregated witness addresses as a tiebreaker.</p>
