<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document describes a format for the representation of the templates
that specify the constraints that can be imposed on BIP32 derivation
paths.</p>
<p>The constraints specified by the templates allow to easily discern
'valid' paths, that match the constraints, and 'invalid' paths, that
exceed the constraints.</p>
<h2 id="Copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>BIP32 derivation path format is universal, and a number of schemes for
derivation were proposed in BIP43 and other documents, such as BIPs
44,45,49,84. The flexibility of the format also allowed industry
participants to implement custom derivation shemes that fit particular
purposes, but not necessarily useful in general.</p>
<p>Even when existing BIPs for derivation schemes are used, their usage is
not uniform across the different wallets, in part because software
vendors might have different considerations and priorities when making
decisions about derivation paths. This creates friction for users, which
might face problems when they try to access their coins using the wallet
that derives addresses differently than the one they used before.</p>
<h3 id="Known_solutions">Known solutions</h3>
<p>The problem is common enough to warrant the creation of a dedicated
website (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://walletsrecovery.org/">walletsrecovery.org</a>) that
tracks paths used by different wallets.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this website has used their own format to
succintly describe multiple derivation paths. As far as author knows, it
was the only publicitly used format to describe path templates before
introduction of this BIP. The format was not specified anywhere beside
the main page of the website. It used <code>|</code> to denote alternative
derivation indexes (example: <code>m/|44'|49'|84'/0'/0'</code>) or whole
alternative paths (<code>m/44'/0'/0'|m/44'/1'/0'</code>).</p>
<p>It was not declared as a template format to use for processing by
software, and seems to be an ad-hoc format only intended for
illustration. In contrast to this ad-hoc format, the format described in
this BIP is intended for unambigouos parsing by software, and to be
easily read by humans at the same time. Humans can visually detect the
'templated' parts of the path more easily than the use of <code>|</code> in the
template could allow. Wider range of paths can be defined in a single
template more succintly and unambiguously.</p>
<h3 id="Intended_use_and_advantages">Intended use and advantages</h3>
<p>Wallet software authors can use the proposed format to describe the
derivation paths that their software uses. This can improve user
experience when switching to different wallet software, restoring access
to old wallets, etc.</p>
<p>Unrestricted derivation path usage might be unsafe in certain contexts.
In particular, when &quot;change&quot; outputs of a transaction are sent to the
addresses derived via paths unknown to the sender, the sender might lose
access to the whole change amount.</p>
<p>A simplistic approach of hard-coding the checks for well-known paths
into software and firmware leads to reduced interoperability. Vendors
cannot choose custom paths that are appropriate for their particular,
non-general-purpose applications, and are forced to shoehorn their
solutions into using well-known paths, or convince other vendors to
support their custom paths. This approach scales poorly.</p>
<p>A flexible approach proposed in this document is to define a standard
notation for &quot;BIP32 path templates&quot; that succintly describes the
constraints to impose on the derivation path.</p>
<p>Wide support for these path templates will increase interoperability and
flexibility of solutions, and will allow vendors and individual
developers to easily define their own custom restrictions. This way,
they will be able to deal with the risks of accidental or malicious use
of unrestricted derivation paths in a more flexible and precise manner.</p>
<p>Well-known path templates can be pre-configured by default on devices
and applications, but users can have an option to turn off the templates
that are not relevant to their uses.</p>
<p>Having a standardized format for custom path templates will enable a
common approach to be developed in the enforcement of
application-specific path restrictions in devices and applications. One
example of such an approach might be for devices to allow
application-specific profiles with path templates and possibly other
custom parameters. Care must be taken to prevent the accidental
installation of malicious or incorrect profiles, though.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The format for the template was choosen to make it easy to read,
convenient and visually unambigous.</p>
<p>Template starts with optional prefix <code>m/</code>, and then one or more sections
delimited by the slash character (<code>/</code>).</p>
<p>Implementations MAY limit the maximum number of sections.</p>
<p>Each section consists of <em>index template</em>, optionally followed by the
hardened marker: either an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) or letter <code>h</code>.</p>
<p>Index template can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An integer value from 0 to 2147483647 (&quot;Unit index template&quot;)</li>
<li>A single <code>*</code> character, which denotes any value from 0 to 2147483647
(&quot;Wildcard index template&quot;)</li>
<li>The <code>{</code> character, followed by a number of <em>index ranges</em> delimited by
commas (<code>,</code>), followed by <code>}</code> character (&quot;Ranged index template&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations MAY limit the maximum number of index ranges within the
Ranged index template.</p>
<p>If an index template is immediately followed by hardened marker, this
means that all values specified in this index template is to be
increased by 2147483648 for the purposes of matching.</p>
<p>Index range can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An integer value from 0 to 2147483647 (&quot;Unit range&quot;)</li>
<li>An integer value from 0 to 2147483647, followed by the <code>-</code> character,
followed by another integer value from 0 to 2147483647 (&quot;Non-unit
range&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>For Non-unit range, value on the left side of the <code>-</code> character is the
range_start, and the value on the right side of the <code>-</code> character is the
range_end.</p>
<p>For Unit range, we say that range_start is equal to range_end, even
though there is no start/end in the Unit range.</p>
<p>Unit index template contains a single index range, which is the Unit
range</p>
<p>Wildcard index template contains a single index range, and we say that
its range_start is set to 0 and its range_end is set to 2147483647</p>
<p>Constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, whitespace MUST NOT appear within the path
template.</li>
<li>Commas within the Ranged index template MUST only appear in between
index ranges.</li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, an index range that matches a single value MUST
be specified as Unit range.</li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, an index range <code>0-2147483647</code> is not allowed,
and MUST be specified as Wildcard index template instead</li>
<li>For Non-unit range, range_end MUST be larger than range_start.</li>
<li>If there is more than one index range within the Ranged index
template, range_start of the second and any subsequent range MUST be
larger than the range_end of the preceeding range.</li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, all representations of integer values larger
than 0 MUST NOT start with character <code>0</code> (no leading zeroes
allowed).</li>
<li>If hardened marker appears within any section in the path template,
all preceding sections MUST also specify hardened matching.</li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, if a hardened marker appears within any section
in the path template, all preceding sections MUST also use the same
hardened marker (either <code>h</code> or <code>'</code>).</li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, trailing slashes (for example, <code>1/2/</code>) and
duplicate slashes (for example, <code>0//1</code>) MUST NOT appear in the
template.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be desireable to have fully unambiguous encoding, where for each
valid path template string, there is no other valid template string that
matches the exact same set of paths. This would enable someone to
compare templates for equality through a simple string equality check,
without any parsing.</p>
<p>To achieve this, two extra rules are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within Ranged index template, subsequent range MUST NOT start with the
value that is equal to the end of the previous range plus one. Thus,
<code>{1,2,3-5}</code> is not allowed, and should be specified as <code>{1-5}</code>
instead. This rule might make templates less convenient for frequent
edits, though.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Only one type of hardened marker should be allowed (either <code>h</code> or
<code>'</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of requiring the second extra rule, implementations can simply
replace one type of marker with another in the template strings before
comparing them.</p>
<h2 id="Full_and_partial_templates">Full and partial templates</h2>
<p>If the template starts with <code>m/</code>, that means that this is the &quot;full&quot;
template, that matches the whole path.</p>
<p>If the template does not start with <code>m/</code>, that means that this is a
&quot;partial&quot; template, and it can be used to match a part of the path, in
the contexts where this might be appropriate (for example, when
constraints for the suffix of the path might be dynamic, while
constraints for the prefix of the path are fixed).</p>
<p>Full template can be combined with partial template, where partial
template extends full template, resulting in new, longer full template.</p>
<p>Partial template can be combined with another partial template,
resulting in new, longer partial template.</p>
<p>Full template can not be combined with another full template.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST support parsing full templates and matching paths
against full templates.</p>
<p>Implementations MAY support parsing partial templates and matching
portions of the paths against partial templates, as well as combining
the templates.</p>
<h2 id="Parsing_result">Parsing result</h2>
<p>The result of successful parsing of a valid path template can be
represented by a list of sections, where each section is a list of index
ranges, where index range is a tuple of (range_start, range_end). The
length of the list of sections is also referred to as the &quot;length of the
template&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="Matching">Matching</h2>
<p>The matching is to be performed against a list of integer values that
represent a BIP32 path (or a portion of BIP32 path, for partial
templates). The length of this list is referred to as the &quot;length of the
path&quot;.</p>
<p>Non-hardened indexes in this list should be represented by values from 0
to 2147483647.</p>
<p>Hardened indexes in this list should be represented by values from
2147483648 to 4294967295.</p>
<p>The matching algorithm:</p>
<p><code>   1. If the length of the path differs from the length of the template, fail</code><br />
<code>   2. For each value V at position N in the path:</code><br />
<code>           If for all index ranges within the section at position N in the template,</code><br />
<code>           value V is either less than range_start, or greater than range_end, fail</code><br />
<code>   3. Otherwise, succeed</code></p>
<h2 id="Formal_specification">Formal specification</h2>
<p>The finite state machine (FSM) for the parser of the described template
format, and the matching formula are specified in TLA+ specification
language at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_parse_tplaplus_spec">https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_parse_tplaplus_spec</a></p>
<p>The specification can be used with TLC checker and accompanying script
to generate test data for the implementations.</p>
<h2 id="Implementations">Implementations</h2>
<p>While the formal specification specifies an FSM, which would be
convenient for implementation without access to rich string handling
facilities, when such facilities are available, the implementation might
use the whole-string deconstruction approach where the templates are
first split into sections, then sections are split into index templates,
and then each index template are parsed individually.</p>
<p>A FSM-based approach can be made close to the formal specification,
though, and the test data generated with TLC checker would give much
better coverage for a FSM based implementation. If the template string
contains several errors, an implementation that uses deconstruction
approach might detect some of these errors earlier than FSM-based
implementation, and vise versa.</p>
<p>At the moment, three implementations exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>FSM implementation in C:
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_c_implementation">https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_c_implementation</a></li>
<li>FSM implementation in Python (micropython compatible):
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_python_implementation">https://github.com/dgpv/bip32_template_python_implementation</a></li>
<li>non-FSM implementation in python: BIP32PathTemplate class in
bitcointx.core.key module of python-bitcointx library
(https://github.com/Simplexum/python-bitcointx)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>The full path template that only contains Unit index templates
represents a fully valid BIP32 path.</p>
<p>There's no other path template standards that is known to the author
currently.</p>
<p>There is a discussion on path templating for bitcoin script descriptors
at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190</a>, which proposes the
format <code>xpub...{0,1}/*</code>, of which the <code>{0,1}/*</code> part would correspond to
the partial path template in the format of this BIP.</p>
<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
<p><code>m/{44,49,84}'/0'/0'/{0-1}/{0-50000}</code> specifies a full template that
matches both external and internal chains of BIP44, BIP49 and BIP84
paths, with a constraint that the address index cannot be larger than
50000</p>
<p>Its representation after parsing can be (using Python syntax, ignoring
full/partial distinction):</p>
<p><code>   [[(2147483692, 2147483692), (2147483697, 2147483697), (2147483732, 2147483732)),</code><br />
<code>    [(2147483648, 2147483648)],</code><br />
<code>    [(2147483648, 2147483648)],</code><br />
<code>    [(0, 1)],</code><br />
<code>    [(0, 50000)]]</code></p>
<p><code>{0-2,33,123}/*</code> specifies a partial template that matches non-hardened
values 0, 1, 2, 33, 123 as first index, and any non-hardened value at
second index</p>
<p>Its representation after parsing can be:</p>
<p><code>   [[(0, 2), (33, 33), (123, 123)], [(0, 2147483647)]]</code></p>
<p><code>*h/0</code> specifies a partial template that matches any hardened index
followed by non-hardened index 0</p>
<p>Its representation after parsing can be:</p>
<p><code>   [[(2147483648, 4294967295)], [(0, 0)]]</code></p>
