</span><span>  Title: Reusable Payment Codes for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
</span><span>  Author: Justus Ranvier &lt;justus@openbitcoinprivacyproject.org&gt;
</span><span>  Comments-Summary: Unanimously Discourage for implementation
</span><span>  Comments-URI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0047
</span><span>  Status: Draft
</span><span>  Type: Informational
</span><span>  Created: 2015-04-24
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP defines a technique for creating a payment code which can be
publicly advertised and associated with a real-life identity without
creating the loss of security or privacy inherent to P2PKH address
reuse.</p>
<p>This BIP is a particular application of BIP43 and is intended to
supplement HD wallets which implement BIP44.</p>
<p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Payment codes add identity information to transactions which is useful
in a merchant-customer interaction while protecting the privacy of
users. Payment codes provide the privacy benefits of Darkwallet-style
Stealth Addresses to SPV clients without requiring the assistance of a
trusted full node and while greatly reducing reliance on blockchain
storage.</p>
<h2 id="Path_levels">Path levels</h2>
<p>We define the following 3 levels in BIP32 path:</p>
<p><code>m / purpose' / coin_type' / identity'</code></p>
<p>The child keys derived from an identity are used in different ways:</p>
<p><code>m / purpose' / coin_type' / identity' / 0</code></p>
<p>The 0th (non-hardened) child is the notification key.</p>
<p><code>m / purpose' / coin_type' / identity' / 0 through 2147483647</code></p>
<p>These (non-hardened) keypairs are used for ECDH to generate deposit
addresses.</p>
<p><code>m / purpose' / coin_type' / identity' / 0' through 2147483647'</code></p>
<p>These (hardened) keypairs are ephemeral payment codes.</p>
<p>Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.</p>
<p>Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.</p>
<h3 id="Purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Purpose is a constant set to 47' (or 0x8000002F) following the BIP43
recommendation. It indicates that the subtree of this node is used
according to this specification.</p>
<h3 id="Coin_type">Coin type</h3>
<p>The coin type field is identical to the same field in BIP44</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<h3 id="Identity">Identity</h3>
<p>The identity derivation level produces an extended public key and its
associated extended private key.</p>
<p>When the extended public key at this level is combined with the metadata
specified in the Representation section below, the resulting entity is
called a &quot;payment code.&quot;</p>
<p>This derivation level is equivalent to the Account level in BIP-44.
Wallets SHOULD treat payment codes as intrinsically part of the BIP-44
account at the same index and create payment codes and accounts as
pairs.</p>
<p>For example, the payment code created represented by (m / 47' / 0' / 0')
is part of the account represented by (m / 44' / 0' / 0').</p>
<p>The second account in a wallet consists of the new account/payment code
pair created by using an index of 1 in as the account/identity level of
both paths.</p>
<p>Incoming payments received via this specification are equivalent to
payments received to BIP-44 addresses, and unspent outputs from both
types of addresses can be used as inputs in the same outgoing
transaction.</p>
<p>Hardened derivation is used at this level.</p>
<p>Except where noted, all keys derived from a payment code use the public
derivation method.</p>
<h2 id="Versions">Versions</h2>
<p>Payment codes contain a version byte which identifies a specific set of
behavior.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, payment codes of different versions are
interoperable. If Alice uses a version x payment code, and Bob uses a
version y payment code, they can still send and receive transactions
between each other.</p>
<p>Currently specified versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 1
<ul>
<li>Address type: P2PKH</li>
<li>Notification type: address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version 2
<ul>
<li>Address type: P2PKH</li>
<li>Notification type: bloom-multisig</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Recommended_Versions">Recommended Versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wallets which have bloom filtering capabilities SHOULD create version
2 payment codes instead of version 1 payment codes.</li>
<li>Version 1 payment codes are only recommended for wallets which lack
access to bloom filtering capability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Version_1">Version 1</h2>
<h3 id="Representation">Representation</h3>
<h4 id="Binary_Serialization">Binary Serialization</h4>
<p>A payment code contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Byte 0: version. required value: 0x01</li>
<li>Byte 1: features bit field. All bits must be zero except where
specified elsewhere in this specification
<ul>
<li>Bit 0: Bitmessage notification</li>
<li>Bits 1-7: reserved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Byte 2: sign. required value: 0x02 or 0x03</li>
<li>Bytes 3 - 34: x value, must be a member of the secp256k1 group</li>
<li>Bytes 35 - 66: chain code</li>
<li>Bytes 67 - 79: reserved for future expansion, zero-filled unless
otherwise noted</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Base58_Serialization">Base58 Serialization</h4>
<p>When a payment code is presented to the user, it SHOULD be presented
encoded in Base58Check form.</p>
<ul>
<li>The version byte is: 0x47 (produces a &quot;P&quot; as the first character of
the serialized form)</li>
<li>The payload is the binary serialization of the payment code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p>In the following examples, Alice and Bob are identities with a
corresponding payment codes. Alice initiates a Bitcoin transaction, and
Bob is the recipient of the transaction.</p>
<p>It is assumed that Alice can easily obtain Bob's payment code via a
suitable method outside the scope of the payment code protocol.</p>
<h4 id="Definitions">Definitions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Payment code: an extended public key and associated metadata which is
associated with a particular identity/account</li>
<li>Notification address: the P2PKH address associated with the
0<sup>th</sup> public key derived from a payment code</li>
<li>Notification transaction: a transaction which sends an output to a
notification address which includes an embedded payment code</li>
<li>Designated input: the first input in the notification transaction
which exposes an secp256k1 pubkey in either its signature script, or
in the redeem script or pubkey script of the output being spent</li>
<li>Designated pubkey: the first secp256k1 pubkey pushed to the stack
during script execution for the designated input</li>
<li>Outpoint: the specific output of a previous transaction which is being
spent. See the Reference section for the binary serialization</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Notification_Transaction">Notification Transaction</h4>
<p>Prior to the first time Alice initiates a transaction to Bob, Alice MUST
inform Bob of her payment code via the following procedure:</p>
<p>Note: this procedure is used if Bob uses a version 1 payment code
(regardless of the the version of Alice's payment code). If Bob's
payment code is not version 1, see the appropriate section in this
specification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice constructs a transaction which sends a small quantity of
bitcoins to Bob's notification address (notification transaction)
<ol>
<li>The inputs selected for this transaction MUST NOT be easily
associated with Alice's notification address</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alice derives a unique shared secret using ECDH:
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice selects the private key corresponding to the designated
pubkey:
a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice selects the public key associated with Bob's notification
address:
B, where B = bG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice calculates a secret point:
S = aB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice calculates a 64 byte blinding factor:
s = HMAC-SHA512(x, o)</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;x&quot; is the x value of the secret point</li>
<li>&quot;o&quot; is the outpoint being spent by the designated input</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alice serializes her payment code in binary form.</li>
<li>Alice renders her payment code (P) unreadable to anyone except Bob:
<ol>
<li>Replace the x value with x':
x' = x XOR (first 32 bytes of s)</li>
<li>Replace the chain code with c':
c' = c XOR (last 32 bytes of s)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alice adds an OP_RETURN output to her transaction which consists of
P.</li>
</ol>
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-01.png" />
<ol>
<li>Bob watches for any transactions which create an output at his
notification address.</li>
<li>When a transaction is received, the client examines it to determine
if it contains a standard OP_RETURN output with an 80 byte payload
(notification transactions).</li>
<li>If the first byte of the payload in a notification transaction is
0x01:
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bob selects the designated pubkey:
A, where A = aG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob selects the private key associated with his notification
address:
b</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob calculates a secret point:
S = bA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob calculates the blinding factor:
s = HMAC-SHA512(x, o)</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;x&quot; is the x value of the secret point</li>
<li>&quot;o&quot; is the outpoint being spent by the designated input.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob interprets the 80 byte payload as a payment code, except:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace the x value with x':
x' = x XOR (first 32 bytes of s)</li>
<li>Replace the chain code with c':
c' = c XOR (last 32 bytes of s)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the updated x value is a member of the secp256k1 group, the
payment code is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the updated x value is not a member of the secp256k1 group,
the payment code is ignored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that Bob's client has received Alice's payment code, it is possible
for Alice to send payments (up to 2<sup>32</sup> payments) to Bob.</p>
<p>Alice will never again need to send a notification transaction to Bob.</p>
<p>Bitcoins received via notification transactions require special handling
in order to avoid privacy leaks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The value of outputs received to notification addresses MUST NOT be
displayed to the user as part of their spendable balance.</li>
<li>Outputs received to notification addresses MUST NOT be used as
inputs for any transaction that involve ECDH calculations using any
of the user's payment codes.</li>
<li>Outputs received to notification addresses MAY be passed through a
mixing service before being added to the user's spendable balance.</li>
<li>Outputs received to notification addresses MAY be donated to miners
using dust-b-gone or an equivalent procedure.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="Standard_Notification_Transaction_Scripts">Standard Notification Transaction Scripts</h5>
<p>Alice SHOULD use an input script in one of the following standard forms
to expose a public key, and compliant applications SHOULD recognize all
of these forms.</p>
<ul>
<li>P2PK (pay to pubkey)</li>
<li>P2PKH (pay to pubkey hash)</li>
<li>Multisig (bare multisig, without P2SH)</li>
<li>a script which spends any of the above script forms via P2SH (pay to
script hash)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compatible wallets MAY provide a method for a user to manually specify
the public key associated with a notification transaction in order to
recover payment codes sent via non-standard notification transactions.</p>
<h5 id="Post-Notification_Privacy_Considerations">Post-Notification Privacy Considerations</h5>
<p>Incautious handling of change outputs from notification transactions may
cause unintended loss of privacy.</p>
<p>The recipient of a transaction which spends a change output from a prior
notification transaction will learn about the potential connection
between the sender and the recipient of the notification transaction.</p>
<p>The following actions are recommended to reduce this risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wallets which support mixing SHOULD mix change outputs from
notification transactions prior to spending them</li>
<li>Wallets which do not support mixing MAY simulate mixing by creating a
transaction which spends the change output to the next external BIP44
address</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Sending">Sending</h4>
<ol>
<li>Each time Alice wants to initiate a transaction to Bob, Alice
derives a unique P2PKH address for the transaction using ECDH as
follows:
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice selects the 0th private key derived from her payment code:
a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice selects the next unused public key derived from Bob's
payment code, starting from zero:
B, where B = bG</p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;next unused&quot; public key is based on an index specific
to the Alice-Bob context, not global to either Alice or Bob</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice calculates a secret point:
S = aB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice calculates a scalar shared secret using the x value of S:
s = SHA256(Sx)</p>
<ol>
<li>If the value of s is not in the secp256k1 group, Alice MUST
increment the index used to derive Bob's public key and try
again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice uses the scalar shared secret to calculate the ephemeral
public key used to generate the P2PKH address for this
transaction:
B' = B + sG</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-04.png" />
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-05.png" />
<ol>
<li>Bob is watching for incoming payments on B' ever since he received
the notification transaction from Alice.
<ol>
<li>Bob calculates n shared secrets with Alice, using the
0<sup>th</sup> public key derived Alice's payment code, and
private keys 0 - n derived from Bob's payment code, where n is
his desired lookahead window.</li>
<li>Bob calculates the ephemeral deposit addresses using the same
procedure as Alice:
B' = B + sG</li>
<li>Bob calculate the private key for each ephemeral address as:
b' = b + s</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-02.png" />
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-03.png" />
<h4 id="Refunds">Refunds</h4>
<p>Because Bob learns Alice's payment code as part of the process of
receiving a payment, Bob has all the information he needs in order to
send a refund to Alice.</p>
<p>A refund transaction is identical to a payment transactions, with only
the roles of the participants switches.</p>
<p>Bob MUST send a notification transaction to Alice prior to the first
time he sends funds to Alice, even if he has received transactions from
her in the past.</p>
<img src="bip-0047/reusable_payment_codes-06.png" />
<h4 id="Anonymous_Payments">Anonymous Payments</h4>
<p>If Alice does not want her payment to Bob to be associated with her
identity, she generates an ephemeral payment code to use for the
transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ephemeral payment codes are the hardened children of a payment code,
starting from an index of zero.</li>
<li>An ephemeral payment code SHOULD only be used for a single outgoing
payment.</li>
<li>The notification address of an ephemeral payment code MUST be
monitored for notification transactions in order to detect incoming
refund payments</li>
<li>The correspondence between BIP44 accounts and ephemeral payment codes
is 1:many</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Cold_Storage">Cold Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unlike traditional watching-only wallets, those associated with
payment codes held in cold storage can not detect incoming payments
immediately.</li>
<li>When the watching-only wallet detects an incoming notification
transaction, it packages the transaction in an implementation-specific
format suitable for transfer to the offline device.</li>
<li>The offline device recovers the payment code, then pre-generates a
large number of relevant keypairs (example: 10000) in order to
minimize the need for air gap round trips.</li>
<li>The offline device then packages the relevant public keys in an
implementation-specific format suitable for transfer to the online
device.</li>
<li>The online device can then watch for incoming payments using a
suitable lookahead window.</li>
<li>If the lookahead window reaches the end of the pre-generated public
keys, the user must generate more keys on the offline device and
transfer them to the online device.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Wallet_Recovery">Wallet Recovery</h4>
<p>Normal operation of a payment code-enabled wallet can be performed by an
SPV client and does not require access to a complete copy of the
blockchain.</p>
<p>Recovering a wallet from a seed, however, does require access to a
fully-indexed blockchain.</p>
<p>The required data may be obtained from copy of the blockchain under the
control of the user, or via a publicly-queriable blockchain explorer.</p>
<p>When querying a public blockchain explorer, wallets SHOULD connect to
the explorer through Tor (or equivalent) and SHOULD avoid grouping
queries in a manner that associates ephemeral addresses with each other.</p>
<p>Previously-spendable funds will generally not be lost or become
inaccessible after a recovery from a seed, but all information regarding
previous outgoing payments will be lost.</p>
<p>In order to recover received funds from a seed, the wallet must obtain
every notification it has ever received to its notification address,
including all spent transactions. It then re-establishes its lookahead
window for each subchain by scanning every derived address sequentially
until it locates a contiguous block of unused addresses of a
user-specified length.</p>
<p>The metadata which a wallet must store to properly process outgoing
transactions consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>A list of every payment code to which the identity has sent a
notification transaction.
<ol>
<li>This list is lost if a wallet must be recovered from a seed.</li>
<li>The recovered wallet MUST send notification transactions as if
it was a newly-created wallet</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The index value corresponding to the next unused pubkey for each
payment code on the previous list
<ol>
<li>This value can be recovered by checking each ephemeral deposit
address in sequence for transactions.</li>
<li>Wallets MAY use a lookahead window capable of detecting gaps in
the address sequence during this recovery operation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The index value of the next unused ephemeral payment code.
<ol>
<li>Recovering all incoming funds associated with ephemeral payment
codes with 100% certainty requires exhausting the entire
2<sup>32</sup> address space of potential ephemeral payment
codes.
<ol>
<li>In most cases, less than 100% certainty is acceptable as
long as a fallback &quot;deep scan&quot; is available as an option to
the user.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The wallet checks the notification address for each ephemeral
payment code for notification transactions in order to recover
associated funds.</li>
<li>Since most ephemeral payment codes will not receive a refund
transaction wallets SHOULD use a large lookahead window for this
recovery operation.</li>
<li>The recovered value MUST be chosen as a number higher than any
ephemeral payment code which has received a notification
transaction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Wallet_Sharing">Wallet Sharing</h3>
<p>Wallets using payment codes generally should not be shared across
multiple devices, given the need to synchronize metadata between each
instance.</p>
<p>If wallets are shared between devices without a synchronization
mechanism, undesirable address reuse can occur.</p>
<p>Wallets may perform an OPTIONAL check for existing transactions to an
ephemeral deposit addresses prior to sending a transaction by checking a
local copy of the blockchain or querying a public blockchain explorer
via Tor or equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="Alternate_Notification_Methods">Alternate Notification Methods</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that no funds will be lost in the event the recipient
must recover their wallet from a seed, the sender MUST send a
notification transaction the first time the sender interacts with a
particular recipient.</p>
<p>A recipient MAY choose to designate alternate notification methods which
the sender may use in addition to a notification transaction.</p>
<p>If the recipient specifies an alternate notification method, a compliant
implementation MAY refrain from continually monitoring the notification
address and SHOULD check the notification address periodically to detect
payments sent by users who can not employ the alternate method.</p>
<p>A recipient specifies their preference for alternate notification by
setting the appropriate bits in the feature byte of their payment code.</p>
<h3 id="Bitmessage_Notification">Bitmessage Notification</h3>
<p>A recipient which prefers to receive notifications via Bitmessage
indicates this preference by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting bit 0 of the features byte to 1</li>
<li>Setting byte 67 of the serialized payment code to the desired
Bitmessage address version</li>
<li>Setting byte 68 of the serialized payment code to the desired
Bitmessage stream number</li>
</ul>
<p>The sender uses this information to construct a valid notification
Bitmessage address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Derive a Bitmessage signing key as:
B = payment code / 0 / 0</li>
<li>Initialize a counter at 1:
n</li>
<li>Derive a candidate encryption key as:
B' = payment code / 0 / n</li>
<li>If the combination of B and B` do not form a valid Bitmessage
address, increment n by one and try again</li>
<li>Use the address version, signing key, encryption key, and stream
number to construct a Bitmessage address per the Bitmessage protocol</li>
</ol>
<p>The sender transmits their payment code in base58 form to the calculated
Bitmessage address.</p>
<p>In order to use Bitmessage notification, the recipient must have a
Bitmessage client which listens at the address which the senders will
derive and is capable of relaying received payment codes to the Bitcoin
wallet.</p>
<h2 id="Version_2">Version 2</h2>
<p>Version 2 payment codes behave identifically to version 1 payment codes,
except as modified below.</p>
<h3 id="Representation-1">Representation</h3>
<h4 id="Binary_Serialization-1">Binary Serialization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Byte 0: version. required value: 0x02</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Protocol-1">Protocol</h3>
<h4 id="Definitions-1">Definitions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Notification change output: the change output from a notification
transaction which which resides in the sender's wallet, but can be
automatically located by the intended recipient</li>
<li>Payment code identifier: a 33 byte representation of a payment code
constructed by prepending 0x02 to the SHA256 hash of the binary
serialization of the payment code</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Notification_Transaction-1">Notification Transaction</h4>
<p>Note: this procedure is used if Bob uses a version 2 payment code
(regardless of the the version of Alice's payment code). If Bob's
payment code is not version 2, see the appropriate section in this
specification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Construct a notification transaction as per the version 1
instructions, except do not create the output to Bob's notification
address</li>
<li>Create a notification change address as follows:
<ol>
<li>Obtain the pubkey corresponding to the next change address</li>
<li>Construct a multisig output in the form:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>OP_1 &lt;Bob&#39;s payment code identifier&gt; &lt;change address pubkey&gt; OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</span></code></pre>
<p>The relative ordering of the payment code identifier and change address
pubkey in the above script MAY be randomized</p>
<p>Bob detects notification transactions by adding his payment code
identifier to his bloom filter.</p>
<ol>
<li>When the filter returns a notification transaction, the sender's
payment code is unblinded using the same procedure as for version 1
notification transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alice's wallet should spend the notification change output at the next
appropriate opportunity.</p>
