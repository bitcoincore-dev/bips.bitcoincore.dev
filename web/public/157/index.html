<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes a new light client protocol in Bitcoin that improves
upon currently available options. The standard light client protocol in
use today, defined in BIP 37<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, has known flaws that weaken the
security and privacy of clients and allow denial-of-service attack
vectors on full nodes<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. The new protocol overcomes these issues by
allowing light clients to obtain compact probabilistic filters of block
content from full nodes and download full blocks if the filter matches
relevant data.</p>
<p>New P2P messages empower light clients to securely sync the blockchain
without relying on a trusted source. This BIP also defines a filter
header, which serves as a commitment to all filters for previous blocks
and provides the ability to efficiently detect malicious or faulty peers
serving invalid filters. The resulting protocol guarantees that light
clients with at least one honest peer are able to identify the correct
block filters.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Bitcoin light clients allow applications to read relevant transactions
from the blockchain without incurring the full cost of downloading and
validating all data. Such applications seek to simultaneously minimize
the trust in peers and the amount of bandwidth, storage space, and
computation required. They achieve this by downloading all block
headers, verifying the proofs of work, and following the longest
proof-of-work chain. Since block headers are a fixed 80-bytes and are
generated every 10 minutes on average, the bandwidth required to sync
the block headers is minimal. Light clients then download only the
blockchain data relevant to them directly from peers and validate
inclusion in the header chain. Though clients do not check the validity
of all blocks in the longest proof-of-work chain, they rely on miner
incentives for security.</p>
<p>BIP 37 is currently the most widely used light client execution mode for
Bitcoin. With BIP 37, a client sends a Bloom filter it wants to watch to
a full node peer, then receives notifications for each new transaction
or block that matches the filter. The client then requests relevant
transactions from the peer along with Merkle proofs of inclusion in the
blocks containing them, which are verified against the block headers.
The Bloom filters match data such as client addresses and unspent
outputs, and the filter size must be carefully tuned to balance the
false positive rate with the amount of information leaked to peer. It
has been shown, however, that most implementations available offer
virtually <em>zero privacy</em> to wallets and other applications<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.
Additionally, malicious full nodes serving light clients can omit
critical data with little risk of detection, which is unacceptable for
some applications (such as Lightning Network clients) that must respond
to certain on-chain events. Finally, honest nodes servicing BIP 37 light
clients may incur significant I/O and CPU resource usage due to
maliciously crafted Bloom filters, creating a denial-of-service (DoS)
vector and disincentizing node operators from supporting the
protocol<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The alternative detailed in this document can be seen as the opposite of
BIP 37: instead of the client sending a filter to a full node peer, full
nodes generate deterministic filters on block data that are served to
the client. A light client can then download an entire block if the
filter matches the data it is watching for. Since filters are
deterministic, they only need to be constructed once and stored on disk,
whenever a new block is connected to the chain. This keeps the
computation required to serve filters minimal, and eliminates the I/O
asymmetry that makes BIP 37 enabled nodes vulnerable. Clients also get
better assurance of seeing all relevant transactions because they can
check the validity of filters received from peers more easily than they
can check completeness of filtered blocks. Finally, client privacy is
improved because blocks can be downloaded from <em>any source</em>, so that no
one peer gets complete information on the data required by a client.
Extremely privacy conscious light clients may opt to anonymously fetch
blocks using advanced techniques such a Private Information
Retrieval<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="Filter_Types">Filter Types</h3>
<p>For the sake of future extensibility and reducing filter sizes, there
are multiple <em>filter types</em> that determine which data is included in a
block filter as well as the method of filter construction/querying. In
this model, full nodes generate one filter per block per filter type
supported.</p>
<p>Each type is identified by a one byte code, and specifies the contents
and serialization format of the filter. A full node MAY signal support
for particular filter types using service bits. The initial filter types
are defined separately in <a href="/158">BIP 158</a>, and
one service bit is allocated to signal support for them.</p>
<h3 id="Filter_Headers">Filter Headers</h3>
<p>This proposal draws inspiration from the headers-first mechanism that
Bitcoin nodes use to sync the block chain<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. Similar to how block
headers have a Merkle commitment to all transaction data in the block,
we define filter headers that have commitments to the block filters.
Also like block headers, filter headers each have a commitment to the
preceding one. Before downloading the block filters themselves, a light
client can download all filter headers for the current block chain and
use them to verify the authenticity of the filters. If the filter header
chains differ between multiple peers, the client can identify the point
where they diverge, then download the full block and compute the correct
filter, thus identifying which peer is faulty.</p>
<p>The canonical hash of a block filter is the double-SHA256 of the
serialized filter. Filter headers are 32-byte hashes derived for each
block filter. They are computed as the double-SHA256 of the
concatenation of the filter hash with the previous filter header. The
previous filter header used to calculate that of the genesis block is
defined to be the 32-byte array of 0's.</p>
<h3 id="New_Messages">New Messages</h3>
<h4 id="getcfilters">getcfilters</h4>
<p><code>getcfilters</code> is used to request the compact filters of a particular
type for a particular range of blocks. The message contains the
following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Filter type for which headers are requested</td></tr>
<tr><td>StartHeight</td><td>uint32</td><td>4</td><td>The height of the first block in the requested range</td></tr>
<tr><td>StopHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The hash of the last block in the requested range</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Nodes SHOULD NOT send <code>getcfilters</code> unless the peer has signaled
support for this filter type. Nodes receiving <code>getcfilters</code> with an
unsupported filter type SHOULD NOT respond.</li>
<li>StopHash MUST be known to belong to a block accepted by the
receiving peer. This is the case if the peer had previously sent a
<code>headers</code> or <code>inv</code> message with that block or any descendents. A
node that receives <code>getcfilters</code> with an unknown StopHash SHOULD NOT
respond.</li>
<li>The height of the block with hash StopHash MUST be greater than or
equal to StartHeight, and the difference MUST be strictly less than
1000.</li>
<li>The receiving node MUST respond to valid requests by sending one
<code>cfilter</code> message for each block in the requested range,
sequentially in order by block height.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cfilter">cfilter</h4>
<p><code>cfilter</code> is sent in response to <code>getcfilters</code>, one for each block in
the requested range. The message contains the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Byte identifying the type of filter being returned</td></tr>
<tr><td>BlockHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>Block hash of the Bitcoin block for which the filter is being returned</td></tr>
<tr><td>NumFilterBytes</td><td>CompactSize</td><td>1-5</td><td>A variable length integer representing the size of the filter in the following field</td></tr>
<tr><td>FilterBytes</td><td>[]byte</td><td>NumFilterBytes</td><td>The serialized compact filter for this block</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>The FilterType SHOULD match the field in the <code>getcfilters</code> request,
and BlockHash must correspond to a block that is an ancestor of
StopHash with height greater than or equal to StartHeight.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="getcfheaders">getcfheaders</h4>
<p><code>getcfheaders</code> is used to request verifiable filter headers for a range
of blocks. The message contains the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Filter type for which headers are requested</td></tr>
<tr><td>StartHeight</td><td>uint32</td><td>4</td><td>The height of the first block in the requested range</td></tr>
<tr><td>StopHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The hash of the last block in the requested range</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Nodes SHOULD NOT send <code>getcfheaders</code> unless the peer has signaled
support for this filter type. Nodes receiving <code>getcfheaders</code> with an
unsupported filter type SHOULD NOT respond.</li>
<li>StopHash MUST be known to belong to a block accepted by the
receiving peer. This is the case if the peer had previously sent a
<code>headers</code> or <code>inv</code> message with that block or any descendents. A
node that receives <code>getcfheaders</code> with an unknown StopHash SHOULD
NOT respond.</li>
<li>The height of the block with hash StopHash MUST be greater than or
equal to StartHeight, and the difference MUST be strictly less than
2,000.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cfheaders">cfheaders</h4>
<p><code>cfheaders</code> is sent in response to <code>getcfheaders</code>. Instead of including
the filter headers themselves, the response includes one filter header
and a sequence of filter hashes, from which the headers can be derived.
This has the benefit that the client can verify the binding links
between the headers. The message contains the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Filter type for which hashes are requested</td></tr>
<tr><td>StopHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The hash of the last block in the requested range</td></tr>
<tr><td>PreviousFilterHeader</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The filter header preceding the first block in the requested range</td></tr>
<tr><td>FilterHashesLength</td><td>CompactSize</td><td>1-3</td><td>The length of the following vector of filter hashes</td></tr>
<tr><td>FilterHashes</td><td>[][32]byte</td><td>FilterHashesLength * 32</td><td>The filter hashes for each block in the requested range</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>The FilterType and StopHash SHOULD match the fields in the
<code>getcfheaders</code> request.</li>
<li>FilterHashesLength MUST NOT be greater than 2,000.</li>
<li>FilterHashes MUST have one entry for each block on the chain
terminating with tip StopHash, starting with the block at height
StartHeight. The entries MUST be the filter hashes of the given type
for each block in that range, in ascending order by height.</li>
<li>PreviousFilterHeader MUST be set to the previous filter header of
first block in the requested range.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="getcfcheckpt">getcfcheckpt</h4>
<p><code>getcfcheckpt</code> is used to request filter headers at evenly spaced
intervals over a range of blocks. Clients may use filter hashes from
<code>getcfheaders</code> to connect these checkpoints, as is described in the
<a href="https://bips.dev/157/#client-operation" title="wikilink">Client Operation</a> section below. The
<code>getcfcheckpt</code> message contains the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Filter type for which headers are requested</td></tr>
<tr><td>StopHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The hash of the last block in the chain that headers are requested for</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Nodes SHOULD NOT send <code>getcfcheckpt</code> unless the peer has signaled
support for this filter type. Nodes receiving <code>getcfcheckpt</code> with an
unsupported filter type SHOULD NOT respond.</li>
<li>StopHash MUST be known to belong to a block accepted by the
receiving peer. This is the case if the peer had previously sent a
<code>headers</code> or <code>inv</code> message with any descendent blocks. A node that
receives <code>getcfcheckpt</code> with an unknown StopHash SHOULD NOT respond.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cfcheckpt">cfcheckpt</h4>
<p><code>cfcheckpt</code> is sent in response to <code>getcfcheckpt</code>. The filter headers
included are the set of all filter headers on the requested chain where
the height is a positive multiple of 1,000. The message contains the
following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Byte Size</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>FilterType</td><td>byte</td><td>1</td><td>Filter type for which headers are requested</td></tr>
<tr><td>StopHash</td><td>[32]byte</td><td>32</td><td>The hash of the last block in the chain that headers are requested for</td></tr>
<tr><td>FilterHeadersLength</td><td>CompactSize</td><td>1-3</td><td>The length of the following vector of filter headers</td></tr>
<tr><td>FilterHeaders</td><td>[][32]byte</td><td>FilterHeadersLength * 32</td><td>The filter headers at intervals of 1,000</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>The FilterType and StopHash SHOULD match the fields in the
<code>getcfcheckpt</code> request.</li>
<li>FilterHeaders MUST have exactly one entry for each block on the
chain terminating in StopHash, where the block height is a multiple
of 1,000 greater than 0. The entries MUST be the filter headers of
the given type for each such block, in ascending order by height.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Node_Operation">Node Operation</h3>
<p>Full nodes MAY opt to support this BIP and generate filters for any of
the specified filter types. Such nodes SHOULD treat the filters as an
additional index of the blockchain. For each new block that is connected
to the main chain, nodes SHOULD generate filters for all supported types
and persist them. Nodes that are missing filters and are already synced
with the blockchain SHOULD reindex the chain upon start-up, constructing
filters for each block from genesis to the current tip. They also SHOULD
keep every checkpoint header in memory, so that <code>getcfcheckpt</code> requests
do not result in many random-access disk reads.</p>
<p>Nodes SHOULD NOT generate filters dynamically on request, as malicious
peers may be able to perform DoS attacks by requesting small filters
derived from large blocks. This would require an asymmetical amount of
I/O on the node to compute and serve, similar to attacks against BIP 37
enabled nodes noted in BIP 111.</p>
<p>Nodes MAY prune block data after generating and storing all filters for
a block.</p>
<h3 id="Client_Operation">Client Operation</h3>
<p>This section provides recommendations for light clients to download
filters with maximal security.</p>
<p>Clients SHOULD first sync the entire block header chain from peers using
the standard headers-first syncing mechanism before downloading any
block filters or filter headers. Clients configured with trusted
checkpoints MAY only sync headers started from the last checkpoint.
Clients SHOULD disconnect any outbound peers whose best chain has
significantly less work than the known longest proof-of-work chain.</p>
<p>Once a client's block headers are in sync, it SHOULD download and verify
filter headers for all blocks and filter types that it might later
download. The client SHOULD send <code>getcfheaders</code> messages to peers and
derive and store the filter headers for each block. The client MAY first
fetch headers at evenly spaced intervals of 1,000 by sending
<code>getcfcheckpt</code>. The header checkpoints allow the client to download
filter headers for different intervals from multiple peers in parallel,
verifying each range of 1,000 headers against the checkpoints.</p>
<p>Unless securely connected to a trusted peer that is serving filter
headers, the client SHOULD connect to multiple outbound peers that
support each filter type to mitigate the risk of downloading incorrect
headers. If the client receives conflicting filter headers from
different peers for any block and filter type, it SHOULD interrogate
them to determine which is faulty. The client SHOULD use <code>getcfheaders</code>
and/or <code>getcfcheckpt</code> to first identify the first filter headers that
the peers disagree on. The client then SHOULD download the full block
from any peer and derive the correct filter and filter header. The
client SHOULD ban any peers that sent a filter header that does not
match the computed one.</p>
<p>Once the client has downloaded and verified all filter headers needed,
<em>and</em> no outbound peers have sent conflicting headers, the client can
download the actual block filters it needs. The client MAY backfill
filter headers before the first verified one at this point if it only
downloaded them starting at a later point. Clients SHOULD persist the
verified filter headers for last 100 blocks in the chain (or whatever
finality depth is desired), to compare against headers received from new
peers after restart. They MAY store more filter headers to avoid
redownloading them if a rescan is later necessary.</p>
<p>Starting from the first block in the desired range, the client now MAY
download the filters. The client SHOULD test that each filter links to
its corresponding filter header and ban peers that send incorrect
filters. The client MAY download multiple filters at once to increase
throughput, though it SHOULD test the filters sequentially. The client
MAY check if a filter is empty before requesting it by checking if the
filter header commits to the hash of the empty filter, saving a round
trip if that is the case.</p>
<p>Each time a new valid block header is received, the client SHOULD
request the corresponding filter headers from all eligible peers. If two
peers send conflicting filter headers, the client should interrogate
them as described above and ban any peers that send an invalid header.</p>
<p>If a client is fetching full blocks from the P2P network, they SHOULD be
downloaded from outbound peers at random to mitigate privacy loss due to
transaction intersection analysis. Note that blocks may be downloaded
from peers that do not support this BIP.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The filter headers and checkpoints messages are defined to help clients
identify the correct filter for a block when connected to peers sending
conflicting information. An alternative solution is to require Bitcoin
blocks to include commitments to derived block filters, so light clients
can verify authenticity given block headers and some additional witness
data. This would require a network-wide change to the Bitcoin consensus
rules, however, whereas this document proposes a solution purely at the
P2P layer.</p>
<p>The constant interval of 1,000 blocks between checkpoints was chosen so
that, given the current chain height and rate of growth, the size of a
<code>cfcheckpt</code> message is not drastically different from a <code>cfheaders</code>
message between two checkpoints. Also, 1,000 is a nice round number, at
least to those of us who think in decimal.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>This light client mode is not compatible with current node deployments
and requires support for the new P2P messages. The node implementation
of this proposal is not incompatible with the current P2P network rules
(ie. doesn't affect network topology of full nodes). Light clients may
adopt protocols based on this as an alternative to the existing BIP 37.
Adoption of this BIP may result in reduced network support for BIP 37.</p>
