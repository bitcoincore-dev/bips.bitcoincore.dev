<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP introduces relative lock-time (RLT) consensus-enforced
semantics of the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction
input to remain invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation
of its corresponding outpoint.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Bitcoin transactions have a sequence number field for each input. The
original idea appears to have been that a transaction in the mempool
would be replaced by using the same input with a higher sequence value.
Although this was not properly implemented, it assumes miners would
prefer higher sequence numbers even if the lower ones were more
profitable to mine. However, a miner acting on profit motives alone
would break that assumption completely. The change described by this BIP
repurposes the sequence number for new use cases without breaking
existing functionality. It also leaves room for future expansion and
other use cases.</p>
<p>The transaction nLockTime is used to prevent the mining of a transaction
until a certain date. nSequence will be repurposed to prevent mining of
a transaction until a certain age of the spent output in blocks or
timespan. This, among other uses, allows bi-directional payment channels
as used in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/raw/master/doc/deployable-lightning.pdf">Hashed Timelock Contracts
(HTLCs)</a>
and
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki#Bidirectional_Payment_Channels">BIP112</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>This specification defines the meaning of sequence numbers for
transactions with an nVersion greater than or equal to 2 for which the
rest of this specification relies on.</p>
<p>All references to median-time-past (MTP) are as defined by BIP113.</p>
<p>If bit (1 &lt;&lt; 31) of the sequence number is set, then no consensus
meaning is applied to the sequence number and can be included in any
block under all currently possible circumstances.</p>
<p>If bit (1 &lt;&lt; 31) of the sequence number is not set, then the sequence
number is interpreted as an encoded relative lock-time.</p>
<p>The sequence number encoding is interpreted as follows:</p>
<p>Bit (1 &lt;&lt; 22) determines if the relative lock-time is time-based or
block based: If the bit is set, the relative lock-time specifies a
timespan in units of 512 seconds granularity. The timespan starts from
the median-time-past of the outputâ€™s previous block, and ends at the MTP
of the previous block. If the bit is not set, the relative lock-time
specifies a number of blocks.</p>
<p>The flag (1&lt;&lt;22) is the highest order bit in a 3-byte signed integer
for use in bitcoin scripts as a 3-byte PUSHDATA with
OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (BIP 112).</p>
<p>This specification only interprets 16 bits of the sequence number as
relative lock-time, so a mask of 0x0000ffff MUST be applied to the
sequence field to extract the relative lock-time. The 16-bit
specification allows for a year of relative lock-time and the remaining
bits allow for future expansion.</p>
<p><img src=bip-0068/encoding.png></img></p>
<p>For time based relative lock-time, 512 second granularity was chosen
because bitcoin blocks are generated every 600 seconds. So when using
block-based or time-based, the same amount of time can be encoded with
the available number of bits. Converting from a sequence number to
seconds is performed by multiplying by 512 = 2^9, or equivalently
shifting up by 9 bits.</p>
<p>When the relative lock-time is time-based, it is interpreted as a
minimum block-time constraint over the input's age. A relative
time-based lock-time of zero indicates an input which can be included in
any block. More generally, a relative time-based lock-time n can be
included into any block produced 512 * n seconds after the mining date
of the output it is spending, or any block thereafter. The mining date
of the output is equal to the median-time-past of the previous block
which mined it.</p>
<p>The block produced time is equal to the median-time-past of its previous
block.</p>
<p>When the relative lock-time is block-based, it is interpreted as a
minimum block-height constraint over the input's age. A relative
block-based lock-time of zero indicates an input which can be included
in any block. More generally, a relative block lock-time n can be
included n blocks after the mining date of the output it is spending, or
any block thereafter.</p>
<p>The new rules are not applied to the nSequence field of the input of the
coinbase transaction.</p>

<h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This BIP is to be deployed by &quot;versionbits&quot; BIP9 using bit 0.</p>
<p>For Bitcoin <strong>mainnet</strong>, the BIP9 <strong>starttime</strong> will be midnight 1st May
2016 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1462060800) and BIP9 <strong>timeout</strong> will be
midnight 1st May 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1493596800).</p>
<p>For Bitcoin <strong>testnet</strong>, the BIP9 <strong>starttime</strong> will be midnight 1st
March 2016 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1456790400) and BIP9 <strong>timeout</strong> will be
midnight 1st May 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1493596800).</p>
<p>This BIP must be deployed simultaneously with BIP112 and BIP113 using
the same deployment mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>The only use of sequence numbers by the Bitcoin Core reference client
software is to disable checking the nLockTime constraints in a
transaction. The semantics of that application are preserved by this
BIP.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the specification section, a number of bits are
undefined by this BIP to allow for other use cases by setting bit (1
&lt;&lt; 31) as the remaining 31 bits have no meaning under this BIP.
Additionally, bits (1 &lt;&lt; 23) through (1 &lt;&lt; 30) inclusive have no
meaning at all when bit (1 &lt;&lt; 31) is unset.</p>
<p>Additionally, this BIP specifies only 16 bits to actually encode
relative lock-time meaning a further 6 are unused (1 &lt;&lt; 16 through 1
&lt;&lt; 21 inclusive). This allows the possibility to increase granularity
by soft-fork, or for increasing the maximum possible relative lock-time
in the future.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to calculate sequence number from relative
lock-time is with bit masks and shifts:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>    // 0 &lt;= nHeight &lt; 65,535 blocks (1.25 years)
</span><span>    nSequence = nHeight;
</span><span>    nHeight = nSequence &amp; 0x0000ffff;
</span><span>    
</span><span>    // 0 &lt;= nTime &lt; 33,554,431 seconds (1.06 years)
</span><span>    nSequence = (1 &lt;&lt; 22) | (nTime &gt;&gt; 9);
</span><span>    nTime = (nSequence &amp; 0x0000ffff) &lt;&lt; 9;
