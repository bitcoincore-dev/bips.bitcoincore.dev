<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document providing
information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for
Bitcoin or its processes or environment. The BIP should provide a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the
feature.</p>
<p>We intend BIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the
design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>Because the BIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository,
their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.</p>
<p>This particular BIP replaces BIP 1 with a more well-defined and clear
process.</p>
<h2 id="Copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is dual-licensed under the Open Publication License and BSD
2-clause license.</p>
<h2 id="BIP_workflow">BIP workflow</h2>
<p>The BIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP
must have a champion -- someone who writes the BIP using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The
BIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether
the idea is BIP-able. Small enhancements or patches to a particular
piece of software often don't require standardisation between multiple
projects; these don't need a BIP and should be injected into the
relevant project-specific development workflow with a patch submission
to the applicable issue tracker. Additionally, many ideas have been
brought forward for changing Bitcoin that have been rejected for various
reasons. The first step should be to search past discussions to see if
an idea has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its
progression. After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is
by posting about the new idea to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">Bitcoin development mailing
list</a>.</p>
<p>Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BIP is meant
to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Asking
the Bitcoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent too
much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected
based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do
the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the
entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds
good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most
areas where Bitcoin is used.</p>
<p>Once the champion has asked the Bitcoin community as to whether an idea
has any chance of acceptance, a draft BIP should be presented to the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev">Bitcoin development mailing
list</a>.
This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft BIP to make it
properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns
about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be
submitted to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs git repository</a>
as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP style as described
below, and named with an alias such as &quot;bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins&quot;
until an editor has assigned it a BIP number (authors MUST NOT
self-assign BIP numbers).</p>
<p>BIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both
the initial idea and the BIP before submitting it for review. However,
wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists
should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include:
setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the BIP
author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a
wiki page or git repository, etc. BIP authors should use their
discretion here.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that a single BIP contain a single key proposal
or new idea. The more focused the BIP, the more successful it tends to
be. If in doubt, split your BIP into several well-focused ones.</p>
<p>When the BIP draft is complete, a BIP editor will assign the BIP a
number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, and
merge the pull request to the BIPs git repository. The BIP editors will
not unreasonably reject a BIP. Reasons for rejecting BIPs include
duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too
unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper
motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with
the Bitcoin philosophy. For a BIP to be accepted it must meet certain
minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the
proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.
The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not
complicate the protocol unduly.</p>
<p>The BIP author may update the draft as necessary in the git repository.
Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull
requests.</p>
<h3 id="Transferring_BIP_Ownership">Transferring BIP Ownership</h3>
<p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to a new
champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a
co-author of the transferred BIP, but that's really up to the original
author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original
author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following
through with the BIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net
(i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to
transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the
BIP. We try to build consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible,
you can always submit a competing BIP.</p>
<p>If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BIP
editors. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely
manner, the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like
such decisions can't be reversed :).</p>
<h3 id="BIP_Editors">BIP Editors</h3>
<p>The current BIP editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Luke Dashjr (<a href="mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org">luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org</a>)</li>
<li>Kalle Alm (<a href="mailto:karljohan-alm@garage.co.jp">karljohan-alm@garage.co.jp</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="BIP_Editor_Responsibilities_&amp;_Workflow">BIP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow</h3>
<p>The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin development mailing list.
Off-list BIP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to the BIP
editors.</p>
<p>For each new BIP that comes in an editor does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the BIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas
must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
accepted.</li>
<li>The title should accurately describe the content.</li>
<li>The BIP draft must have been sent to the Bitcoin development mailing
list for discussion.</li>
<li>Motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) must be
addressed.</li>
<li>The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given
specification.</li>
<li>Licensing terms must be acceptable for BIPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the BIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.</p>
<p>Once the BIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a
&quot;pull request&quot; to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">BIPs git
repository</a> where it may get further
feedback.</p>
<p>The BIP editor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a BIP number in the pull request.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Merge the pull request when it is ready.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>List the BIP in <a href="README.mediawiki" title="wikilink">README.mediawiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial
responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP changes, and update BIP
headers as appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="BIP_format_and_structure">BIP format and structure</h2>
<h3 id="Specification">Specification</h3>
<p>BIPs should be written in mediawiki format.</p>
<p>Each BIP should have the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (<a href="https://bips.dev/2/#BIP_header_preamble" title="wikilink">see
below</a>).</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Abstract -- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
being addressed.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Copyright -- The BIP must be explicitly licensed under acceptable
copyright terms (<a href="https://bips.dev/2/#BIP_licensing" title="wikilink">see below</a>).</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be
detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for
any of the current Bitcoin platforms.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs that want to change
the Bitcoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing
protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing
what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were
made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and
related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus
within the community and discuss important objections or concerns
raised during discussion.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Backwards compatibility -- All BIPs that introduce backwards
incompatibilities must include a section describing these
incompatibilities and their severity. The BIP must explain how the
author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Reference implementation -- The reference implementation must be
completed before any BIP is given status &quot;Final&quot;, but it need not be
completed before the BIP is accepted. It is better to finish the
specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before
writing code. The final implementation must include test code and
documentation appropriate for the Bitcoin protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="BIP_header_preamble">BIP header preamble</h4>
<p>Each BIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers
must appear in the following order. Headers marked with &quot;*&quot; are
optional and are described below. All other headers are required.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>  BIP: &lt;BIP number, or &quot;?&quot; before being assigned&gt;
</span><span>* Layer: &lt;Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications&gt;
</span><span>  Title: &lt;BIP title; maximum 44 characters&gt;
</span><span>  Author: &lt;list of authors&#39; real names and email addrs&gt;
</span><span>* Discussions-To: &lt;email address&gt;
</span><span>* Comments-Summary: &lt;summary tone&gt;
</span><span>  Comments-URI: &lt;links to wiki page for comments&gt;
</span><span>  Status: &lt;Draft | Active | Proposed | Deferred | Rejected |
</span><span>           Withdrawn | Final | Replaced | Obsolete&gt;
</span><span>  Type: &lt;Standards Track | Informational | Process&gt;
</span><span>  Created: &lt;date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format&gt;
</span><span>  License: &lt;abbreviation for approved license(s)&gt;
</span><span>* License-Code: &lt;abbreviation for code under different approved license(s)&gt;
</span><span>* Post-History: &lt;dates of postings to bitcoin mailing list, or link to thread in mailing list archive&gt;
</span><span>* Requires: &lt;BIP number(s)&gt;
</span><span>* Replaces: &lt;BIP number&gt;
</span><span>* Superseded-By: &lt;BIP number&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Layer header (only for Standards Track BIPs) documents which layer
of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See <a href="/123">BIP
123</a> for definitions of the various BIP
layers. Activation of this BIP implies activation of BIP 123.</p>
<p>The Author header lists the names and email addresses of all the
authors/owners of the BIP. The format of the Author header value must be</p>
<p><code> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;</code></p>
<p>If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.</p>
<p>While a BIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft
phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL
where the BIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary
if the BIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the
bitcoin email mailing lists.</p>
<p>The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.</p>
<p>The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number,
while Post-History is used to record when new versions of the BIP are
posted to bitcoin mailing lists. Dates should be in yyyy-mm-dd format,
e.g. 2001-08-14. Post-History is permitted to be a link to a specific
thread in a mailing list archive.</p>
<p>BIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the BIP numbers that this
BIP depends on.</p>
<p>BIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a BIP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the
BIP that replaces the current document. The newer BIP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the BIP that it rendered
obsolete.</p>
<h4 id="Auxiliary_Files">Auxiliary Files</h4>
<p>BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Auxiliary files
should be included in a subdirectory for that BIP, or must be named
BIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where &quot;XXXX&quot; is the BIP number, &quot;Y&quot; is a serial number
(starting at 1), and &quot;ext&quot; is replaced by the actual file extension
(e.g. &quot;png&quot;).</p>
<h2 id="BIP_types">BIP types</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of BIP:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Standards Track BIP describes any change that affects most or all
Bitcoin implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a
change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or
addition that affects the interoperability of applications using
Bitcoin. Standards Track BIPs consist of two parts, a design document
and a reference implementation.</li>
<li>An Informational BIP describes a Bitcoin design issue, or provides
general guidelines or information to the Bitcoin community, but does
not propose a new feature. Informational BIPs do not necessarily
represent a Bitcoin community consensus or recommendation, so users
and implementors are free to ignore Informational BIPs or follow their
advice.</li>
<li>A Process BIP describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a
change to (or an event in) a process. Process BIPs are like Standards
Track BIPs but apply to areas other than the Bitcoin protocol itself.
They may propose an implementation, but not to Bitcoin's codebase;
they often require community consensus; unlike Informational BIPs,
they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free
to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to
the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment
used in Bitcoin development. Any meta-BIP is also considered a Process
BIP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BIP_status_field">BIP status field</h2>
<h3 id="Specification-1">Specification</h3>
<p>The typical paths of the status of BIPs are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="bip-0002/process.png"></img></p>
<p>Champions of a BIP may decide on their own to change the status between
Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn. A BIP editor may also change the status
to Deferred when no progress is being made on the BIP.</p>
<p>A BIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed, when
the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation (where
applicable), and has community plans to progress it to the Final status.</p>
<p>BIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected
status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in
three years. Such a BIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion
provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the
proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as
described in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>A Proposed BIP may progress to Final only when specific criteria
reflecting real-world adoption has occurred. This is different for each
BIP depending on the nature of its proposed changes, which will be
expanded on below. Evaluation of this status change should be
objectively verifiable, and/or be discussed on the development mailing
list.</p>
<p>When a Final BIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to
Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must
also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.</p>
<p>A process BIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves
rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a proposal is said to have
rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development
mailing list for at least one month, and no person maintains any
unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive
objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have
been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such
circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="Progression_to_Final_status">Progression to Final status</h4>
<p>A soft-fork BIP strictly requires a clear miner majority expressed by
blockchain voting (eg, using BIP 9). In addition, if the economy seems
willing to make a &quot;no confidence&quot; hard-fork (such as a change in
proof-of-work algorithm), the soft-fork does not become Final for as
long as such a hard-fork might have majority support, or at most three
months. Soft-fork BIPs may also set additional requirements for their
adoption. Because of the possibility of changes to miner dynamics,
especially in light of delegated voting (mining pools), it is highly
recommended that a supermajority vote around 95% be required by the BIP
itself, unless rationale is given for a lower threshold.</p>
<p>A hard-fork BIP requires adoption from the entire Bitcoin economy,
particularly including those selling desirable goods and services in
exchange for bitcoin payments, as well as Bitcoin holders who wish to
spend or would spend their bitcoins (including selling for other
currencies) differently in the event of such a hard-fork. Adoption must
be expressed by de facto usage of the hard-fork in practice (ie, not
merely expressing public support, although that is a good step to
establish agreement before adoption of the BIP). This economic adoption
cannot be established merely by a super-majority, except by literally
forcing the minority to accept the hard-fork (whether this is viable or
not is outside the scope of this document).</p>
<p>Peer services BIPs should be observed to be adopted by at least 1% of
public listening nodes for one month.</p>
<p>API/RPC and application layer BIPs must be implemented by at least two
independent and compatible software applications.</p>
<p>Software authors are encouraged to publish summaries of what BIPs their
software supports to aid in verification of status changes. Good
examples of this at the time of writing this BIP, can be observed in
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md">Bitcoin Core's doc/bips.md
file</a> as
well as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/wallet/README.specs.md">Bitcoin Wallet for Android's wallet/README.specs.md
file</a>.</p>
<p>These criteria are considered objective ways to observe the de facto
adoption of the BIP, and are not to be used as reasons to oppose or
reject a BIP. Should a BIP become actually and unambiguously adopted
despite not meeting the criteria outlined here, it should still be
updated to Final status.</p>
<h3 id="Rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>Why is this necessary at all?</p>
<ul>
<li>BIP 1 defines an ambiguous criteria for the Status field of BIPs,
which is often a source of confusion. As a result, many BIPs with
significant real-world use have been left as Draft or Proposed status
longer than appropriate. By giving objective criteria to judge the
progression of BIPs, this proposal aims to help keep the Status
accurate and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p>How is the entire Bitcoin economy defined by people selling
goods/services and holders?</p>
<ul>
<li>For Bitcoin to function as a currency, it must be accepted as payment.
Bitcoins have no value if you cannot acquire anything in exchange for
them. If everyone accepting such payments requires a particular set of
consensus rules, &quot;bitcoins&quot; are de facto defined by that set of
rules - this is already the case today. If those consensus rules are
expected to broaden (as with a hard-fork), those merchants need to
accept payments made under the new set of rules, or they will reject
&quot;bitcoins&quot; as invalid. Holders are relevant to the degree in that they
choose the merchants they wish to spend their bitcoins with, and could
also as a whole decide to sell under one set of consensus rules or the
other, thus flooding the market with bitcoins and crashing the price.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why aren't <x> included in the economy?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some entities may, to some degree, also be involved in offering goods
and/or services in exchange for bitcoins, thus in that capacity (but
not their capacity as <x>) be involved in the economy.</li>
<li>Miners are not included in the economy, because they merely *rely
on* others to sell/spend their otherwise-worthless mined produce.
Therefore, they must accept everyone else's direction in deciding the
consensus rules.</li>
<li>Exchanges are not included in the economy, because they merely provide
services of connecting the merchants and users who wish to trade. Even
if all exchanges were to defect from Bitcoin, those merchants and
users can always trade directly and/or establish their own exchanges.</li>
<li>Developers are not included in the economy, since they merely write
code, and it is up to others to decide to use that code or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they're doing something important and have invested a lot in
Bitcoin! Shouldn't they be included in such an important decision?</p>
<ul>
<li>This BIP does not aim to address what &quot;should&quot; be the basis of
decisions. Such a statement, no matter how perfect in its
justification, would be futile without some way to force others to use
it. The BIP process does not aim to be a kind of forceful &quot;governance&quot;
of Bitcoin, merely to provide a collaborative repository for proposing
and providing information on standards, which people may voluntarily
adopt or not. It can only hope to achieve accuracy in regard to the
&quot;Status&quot; field by striving to reflect the reality of *how things
actually are*, rather than *how they should be*.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if a single merchant wishes to block a hard-fork?</p>
<ul>
<li>This BIP addresses only the progression of the BIP Status field, not
the deployment of the hard-fork (or any other change) itself.</li>
<li>Regardless, one shop cannot operate in a vacuum: if they are indeed
alone, they will soon find themselves no longer selling in exchange
for bitcoin payments, as nobody else would exist willing to use the
previous blockchain to pay them. If they are no longer selling, they
cease to meet the criteria herein which enables their veto.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about a small number of merchants (maybe only two) who sell products
to each other?</p>
<ul>
<li>In this scenario, it would seem the previous Bitcoin is alive and
working, and that the hard-fork has failed. How to resolve such a
split is outside the scope of this BIP.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can economic agreement veto a soft-fork?</p>
<ul>
<li>The group of miners is determined by the consensus rules for the
dynamic-membership multi-party signature (for Bitcoin, the
proof-of-work algorithm), which can be modified with a hard-fork.
Thus, if the same conditions required to modify this group are met in
opposition to a soft-fork, the miner majority supporting the soft-fork
is effectively void because the economy can decide to replace them
with another group of would-be miners who do not support the
soft-fork.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if the economy decides to hard-fork away from a
controversial soft-fork, more than three months later?</p>
<ul>
<li>The controversial soft-fork, in this circumstance, changes from Final
to Replaced status to reflect the nature of the hard-fork replacing
the previous (final) soft-fork.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the ideal percentage of listening nodes needed to adopt peer
services proposals?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is unknown, and set rather arbitrarily at this time. For a random
selection of peers to have at least one other peer implementing the
extension, 13% or more would be necessary, but nodes could continue to
scan the network for such peers with perhaps some reasonable success.
Furthermore, service bits exist to help identification upfront.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it necessary for at least two software projects to release an
implementation of API/RPC and application layer BIPs, before they become
Final?</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is only one implementation of a specification, there is no
other program for which a standard interface is used with or needed.</li>
<li>Even if there are only two projects rather than more, some standard
coordination between them exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if a BIP is proposed that only makes sense for a single specific
project?</p>
<ul>
<li>The BIP process exists for standardisation between independent
projects. If something only affects one project, it should be done
through that project's own internal processes, and never be proposed
as a BIP in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BIP_comments">BIP comments</h2>
<h3 id="Specification-2">Specification</h3>
<p>Each BIP should, in its preamble, link to a public wiki page with a
summary tone of the comments on that page. Reviewers of the BIP who
consider themselves qualified, should post their own comments on this
wiki page. The comments page should generally only be used to post final
comments for a completed BIP. If a BIP is not yet completed, reviewers
should instead post on the applicable development mailing list thread to
allow the BIP author(s) to address any concerns or problems pointed out
by the review.</p>
<p>Some BIPs receive exposure outside the development community prior to
completion, and other BIPs might not be completed at all. To avoid a
situation where critical BIP reviews may go unnoticed during this
period, reviewers may, at their option, still post their review on the
comments page, provided they first post it to the mailing list and plan
to later remove or revise it as applicable based on the completed
version. Such revisions should be made by editing the previous review
and updating the timestamp. Reviews made prior to the complete version
may be removed if they are no longer applicable and have not been
updated in a timely manner (eg, within one month).</p>
<p>Pages must be named after the full BIP number (eg, &quot;BIP 0001&quot;) and
placed in the &quot;Comments&quot; namespace. For example, the link for BIP 1 will
be <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001</a> .</p>
<p>Comments posted to this wiki should use the following format:</p>
<p><code>   </code><Your opinion><code> --</code><Your name><code>, &lt;Date of posting, as YYYY-MM-DD&gt;</code></p>
<p>BIPs may also choose to list a second forum for BIP comments, in
addition to the BIPs wiki. In this case, the second forum's URI should
be listed below the primary wiki's URI.</p>
<p>After some time, the BIP itself may be updated with a summary tone of
the comments. Summary tones may be chosen from the following, but this
BIP does not intend to cover all possible nuances and other summaries
may be used as needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>No comments yet.</li>
<li>Unanimously Recommended for implementation</li>
<li>Unanimously Discourage for implementation</li>
<li>Mostly Recommended for implementation, with some Discouragement</li>
<li>Mostly Discouraged for implementation, with some Recommendation</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the preamble to BIP 1 might be updated to include the line:</p>
<p><code>   Comments-Summary: No comments yet.</code><br />
<code>   Comments-URI: </code><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001"><code>https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0001</code></a><br />
<code>                 </code><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://some-other-wiki.org/BIP_1_Comments"><code>https://some-other-wiki.org/BIP_1_Comments</code></a></p>
<p>These fields must follow the &quot;Discussions-To&quot; header defined in BIP 1
(if that header is not present, it should follow the position where it
would be present; generally this is immediately above the Status
header).</p>
<p>To avoid doubt: comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a
BIP, and neither should be directly influencing the other.</p>
<h3 id="Rationale-1">Rationale</h3>
<p>What is the purpose of BIP comments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Various BIPs have been adopted (the criteria required for &quot;Final&quot;
Status) despite being considered generally inadvisable. Some presently
regard BIPs as a &quot;good idea&quot; simply by virtue of them being assigned a
BIP number. Due to the low barrier of entry for submission of new
BIPs, it seems advisable for a way for reviewers to express their
opinions on them in a way that is consumable to the public without
needing to review the entire development discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will BIP comments be censored or limited to particular
participants/&quot;experts&quot;?</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants should freely refrain from commenting outside of their
area of knowledge or expertise. However, comments should not be
censored, and participation should be open to the public.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BIP_licensing">BIP licensing</h2>
<h3 id="Specification-3">Specification</h3>
<p>New BIPs may be accepted with the following licenses. Each new BIP must
identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. The License
header in the preamble must be placed after the Created header. Each
license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below.</p>
<p>For example, a preamble might include the following License header:</p>
<p><code>   License: BSD-2-Clause</code><br />
<code>            GNU-All-Permissive</code></p>
<p>In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the OSI-approved
BSD 2-clause license as well as the GNU All-Permissive License, and
anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with
the terms of *either* license. In other words, the license list is an
&quot;OR choice&quot;, not an &quot;AND also&quot; requirement.</p>
<p>It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP
text. An optional License-Code header is placed after the License
header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective
abbreviation given below.</p>
<p>For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header
might look like:</p>
<p><code>   License: BSD-2-Clause</code><br />
<code>            GNU-All-Permissive</code><br />
<code>   License-Code: GPL-2.0+</code></p>
<p>In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under the BSD or
All-Permissive licenses, but only under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL), version 2 or newer. If the code were to be
available under *only* version 2 exactly, the &quot;+&quot; symbol should be
removed from the license abbreviation. For a later version (eg, GPL
3.0), you would increase the version number (and retain or remove the
&quot;+&quot; depending on intent).</p>
<p><code>   License-Code: GPL-2.0   # This refers to GPL v2.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.</code><br />
<code>   License-Code: GPL-2.0+  # This refers to GPL v2.0 *or later*.</code><br />
<code>   License-Code: GPL-3.0   # This refers to GPL v3.0 *only*, no later license versions are acceptable.</code><br />
<code>   License-Code: GPL-3.0+  # This refers to GPL v3.0 *or later*.</code></p>
<p>In the event that the licensing for the text or code is too complicated
to express with a simple list of alternatives, the list should instead
be replaced with the single term &quot;Complex&quot;. In all cases, details of the
licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.</p>
<p>BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved
terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable licenses *in
addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the
acceptable license(s) should be listed in the License and License-Code
headers.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended_licenses">Recommended licenses</h4>

</ul>
<p>In addition, it is recommended that literal code included in the BIP be
dual-licensed under the same license terms as the project it modifies.
For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be
dual-licensed under the MIT license terms as well as one of the above
with the rest of the BIP text.</p>

<h4 id="Not_acceptable_licenses">Not acceptable licenses</h4>
<p>All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not
acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal unless a later BIP
extends this one to add them. However, BIPs predating the acceptance of
this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these
abbreviation when no other license is granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>OPL: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://opencontent.org/openpub/">Open Publication License, version
1.0</a></li>
<li>PD: Released into the public domain</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Rationale-2">Rationale</h3>
<p>BIP 1 allowed the Open Publication License or releasing into the public
domain; was this insufficient?</p>
<ul>
<li>The OPL is generally regarded as obsolete, and not a license suitable
for new publications.</li>
<li>Many are unfamiliar with the OPL terms, and may just prefer to use the
public domain rather than license under uncertain terms.</li>
<li>The OPL license terms allowed for the author to prevent publication
and derived works, which was widely considered inappropriate for
Bitcoin standards.</li>
<li>Public domain is not universally recognised as a legitimate action,
thus it is inadvisable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are there software licenses included?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some BIPs, especially consensus layer, may include literal code in the
BIP itself which may not be available under the exact license terms of
the BIP.</li>
<li>Despite this, not all software licenses would be acceptable for
content included in BIPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is Public Domain no longer acceptable for new BIPs?</p>
<ul>
<li>In some jurisdictions, public domain is not recognised as a legitimate
legal action, leaving the BIP simply copyrighted with no
redistribution or modification allowed at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Changes_from_BIP_1">Changes from BIP 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Acceptable licenses are entirely rechosen, allowing a wide variety of
open licenses, while prohibiting the problematic older choices.</li>
<li>Accepted Status has been renamed to Proposed.</li>
<li>An implementation is now required (when applicable) before BIPs can
proceed to Proposed Status.</li>
<li>BIP Comments are newly introduced.</li>
<li>The License preamble headers have been added.</li>
<li>The Layer header is included from BIP 123.</li>
<li>Non-image auxiliary files are permitted in the bip-XXXX subdirectory.</li>
<li>Email addresses are now required for authors.</li>
<li>The Post-History header may be provided as a link instead of a simple
date.</li>
<li>Markdown format is no longer permitted for BIPs.</li>
<li>The Resolution header has been dropped, as it is not applicable to a
decentralised system where no authority exists to make final
decisions.</li>
