<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP proposes replacing the fixed one megabyte maximum block size
with a maximum size that grows over time at a predictable rate.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Transaction volume on the Bitcoin network has been growing, and will
soon reach the one-megabyte-every-ten-minutes limit imposed by the one
megabyte maximum block size. Increasing the maximum size reduces the
impact of that limit on Bitcoin adoption and growth.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>After deployment (see the Deployment section for details), the maximum
allowed size of a block on the main network shall be calculated based on
the timestamp in the block header.</p>
<p>The maximum size shall be 8,000,000 bytes at a timestamp of 2016-01-11
00:00:00 UTC (timestamp 1452470400), and shall double every 63,072,000
seconds (two years, ignoring leap years), until 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC
(timestamp 2083190400). The maximum size of blocks in between doublings
will increase linearly based on the block's timestamp. The maximum size
of blocks after 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC shall be 8,192,000,000 bytes.</p>
<p>Expressed in pseudo-code, using integer math, assuming that
block_timestamp is after the activation time (as described in the
Deployment section below):</p>
<p><code>   function max_block_size(block_timestamp):</code></p>
<p><code>       time_start = 1452470400</code><br />
<code>       time_double = 60*60*24*365*2</code><br />
<code>       size_start = 8000000</code><br />
<code>       if block_timestamp &gt;= time_start+time_double*10</code><br />
<code>           return size_start * 2^10</code></p>
<p><code>       // Piecewise-linear-between-doublings growth:</code><br />
<code>       time_delta = block_timestamp - time_start</code><br />
<code>       doublings = time_delta / time_double</code><br />
<code>       remainder = time_delta % time_double</code><br />
<code>       interpolate = (size_start * 2^doublings * remainder) / time_double</code><br />
<code>       max_size = size_start * 2^doublings + interpolate</code></p>
<p><code>       return max_size</code></p>
<h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Deployment shall be controlled by hash-power supermajority vote (similar
to the technique used in BIP34), but the earliest possible activation
time is 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC.</p>
<p>Activation is achieved when 750 of 1,000 consecutive blocks in the best
chain have a version number with the first, second, third, and thirtieth
bits set (0x20000007 in hex). The activation time will be the timestamp
of the 750'th block plus a two week (1,209,600 second) grace period to
give any remaining miners or services time to upgrade to support larger
blocks. If a supermajority is achieved more than two weeks before
2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC, the activation time will be 2016-01-11 00:00:00
UTC.</p>
<p>Block version numbers are used only for activation; once activation is
achieved, the maximum block size shall be as described in the
specification section, regardless of the version number of the block.</p>
<h2 id="Test_network">Test network</h2>
<p>Test network parameters are the same as the main network, except
starting earlier with easier supermajority conditions and a shorter
grace period:</p>
<p><code>   starting time: 1 Aug 2015 (timestamp 1438387200)</code><br />
<code>   activation condition: 75 of 100 blocks</code><br />
<code>   grace period: 24 hours</code></p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The initial size of 8,000,000 bytes was chosen after testing the current
reference implementation code with larger block sizes and receiving
feedback from miners on bandwidth-constrained networks (in particular,
Chinese miners behind the Great Firewall of China).</p>
<p>The doubling interval was chosen based on long-term growth trends for
CPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. The 20-year limit was chosen
because exponential growth cannot continue forever. If long-term trends
do not continue, maximum block sizes can be reduced by miner consensus
(a soft-fork).</p>
<p>Calculations are based on timestamps and not blockchain height because a
timestamp is part of every block's header. This allows implementations
to know a block's maximum size after they have downloaded it's header,
but before downloading any transactions.</p>
<p>The deployment plan is taken from Jeff Garzik's proposed BIP100 block
size increase, and is designed to give miners, merchants, and
full-node-running-end-users sufficient time to upgrade to software that
supports bigger blocks. A 75% supermajority was chosen so that one large
mining pool does not have effective veto power over a blocksize
increase. The version number scheme is designed to be compatible with
Pieter's Wuille's proposed &quot;Version bits&quot; BIP, and to not interfere with
any other consensus rule changes in the process of being rolled out.</p>
<h2 id="Objections_to_this_proposal">Objections to this proposal</h2>
<p>Raising the 1MB block size has been <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=1mb+limit+site%3Abitcointalk.org">discussed and debated for
years</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Centralization_of_full_nodes">Centralization of full nodes</h3>
<p>The number of fully-validating nodes reachable on the network has been
steadily declining. Increasing the capacity of the network to handle
transactions by increasing the maximum block size may accelerate that
decline, meaning a less distributed network that is more vulnerable to
disruption. The size of this effect is debatable; the author of this BIP
believes that the decline in fully validating nodes on the network is
largely due to the availability of convenient, attractive, secure,
lightweight wallet software and the general trend away from computing on
desktop computers to mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Increasing the capacity of the network to handle transactions should
enable increased adoption by users and businesses, especially in areas
of the world where existing financial infrastructure is weak. That could
lead to a more robust network with nodes running in more political
jurisdictions.</p>
<h3 id="Centralization_of_mining:_costs">Centralization of mining: costs</h3>
<p>Miners benefit from low-latency, high-bandwidth connections because they
increase their chances of winning a &quot;block race&quot; (two or more blocks
found at approximately the same time). With the current peer-to-peer
networking protocol, announcing larger blocks requires more bandwidth.
If the costs grow high enough, the result will be a very small number of
very large miners.</p>
<p>The limits proposed by this BIP are designed so that running a fully
validating node has very modest costs, which, if current trends in the
cost of technology continue, will become even less expensive over time.</p>
<h3 id="Centralization_of_mining:_big-block_attacks">Centralization of mining: big-block attacks</h3>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/008820.html">Simulations
show</a>
that with the current peer-to-peer protocol, miners behind high-latency
or low-bandwidth links are at a disadvantage compared to miners
connected to a majority of hashpower via low-latency, high-bandwidth
links. Larger blocks increase the advantage of miners with
high-bandwidth connections, although that advantage can be minimized
with changes to the way new blocks are announced (e.g.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/">http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/</a> ).</p>
<p>If latency and bandwidth to other miners were the only variable that
affected the profitability of mining, and miners were driven purely by
profit, the end result would be one miner running on one machine, where
latency was zero and bandwidth was essentially infinite.</p>
<p>However, many other factors influence miner profitability, including
cost of electricity and labor and real estate, ability to use waste heat
productively, access to capital to invest in mining equipment, etc.
Increasing the influence of bandwidth in the mining profitability
equation will not necessarily lead to more centralization.</p>
<h3 id="Unspent_Transaction_Output_Growth">Unspent Transaction Output Growth</h3>
<p>This BIP makes no attempt to restrict the approximately 100% per-year
growth in unspent transaction outputs (see
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh">http://gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh</a> for details), because the author
believe that problem should be solved by a further restriction on blocks
described in a separate BIP (perhaps an additional limit on how much the
transactions in any block may increase the UTXO set size).</p>
<h2 id="Long-term_fee_incentives">Long-term fee incentives</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/block-size-and-miner-fees-again">http://gavinandresen.ninja/block-size-and-miner-fees-again</a></p>
<h2 id="Other_solutions_considered">Other solutions considered</h2>
<p>There have been dozens of proposals for increasing the block size over
the years. Some notable ideas:</p>
<h3 id="One-time_increase">One-time increase</h3>
<p>A small, quick one-time increase to, for example, 2MB blocks, would be
the most conservative option.</p>
<p>However, a one-time increase requires just as much care in testing and
deployment as a longer-term fix. And the entire debate over how large or
small a limit is appropriate would be repeated as soon as the new limit
was reached.</p>
<h3 id="Dynamic_limit_proposals">Dynamic limit proposals</h3>
<p>BIP 100 proposes a dynamic limit determined by miner preferences
expressed in coinbase transactions, with limits on the rate of growth.
It gives miners more direct control over the maximum block size, which
some people see as an advantage over this proposal and some see as a
disadvantage. It is more complex to implement, because the maximum
allowed size for a block depends on information contained in coinbase
transactions from previous blocks (which may not be immediately known if
block contents are being fetched out-of-order in a 'headers-first'
mode).</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521.0">Meni Rosenfeld has
proposed</a> that miners
sacrifice mining reward to &quot;pay for&quot; bigger blocks, so there is an
incentive to create bigger blocks only if transaction fees cover the
cost of creating a larger block. This proposal is significantly more
complex to implement, and it is not clear if a set of parameters for
setting the cost of making a block bigger can be found that is not
equivalent to a centrally-controlled network-wide minimum transaction
fee.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>This is a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol; anybody running
code that fully validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time
or they will risk rejecting a chain containing larger-than-one-megabyte
blocks.</p>
<p>Simplified Payment Verification software is not affected, unless it
makes assumptions about the maximum depth of a transaction's merkle
branch based on the minimum size of a transaction and the maximum block
size.</p>
