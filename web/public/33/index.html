<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>As the Bitcoin network scales, roles are fast becoming specialised. In
the beginning, a single Bitcoin user would perform the synonymous roles
of miner, merchant and end-user. With the growth however of this system,
these functions are being abstracted away to specialised services as a
natural part of Bitcoin's growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's blockchain becomes more unwieldy for end users over time,
negatively affecting the usability of Bitcoin clients. As it grows, it
becomes ever more impractical to deal with on portable devices or low
end machines. Several proposals have been put forward to deal with this
such as lightweight (headers-only) clients and skipping validation for
blocks before the last checkpoint. However these measures are at best
stop-gap workarounds to stave off a growing problem.</p>
<p>This document will examine a proposal which will be termed <em>stratized
nodes</em>, a modification of an earlier concept termed <em>blockchain
service</em>.</p>
<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>Jan Moller created BCCAPI in 2011. BCCAPI allowed a user's client to
delegate blockchain interaction to a remote server. This server would
store and manage the blockchain while the user client would run queries
against that server.</p>
<p>ThomasV later created Electrum server. BCCAPI's server backend was
proprietary, and Electrum required a full Free Software stack.
Electrum's server was an adhoc temporary replacement. As it grew and
became used, issues started to appear in its design.</p>
<p>Marek Palatinus (slush) drafted a new standard called Stratum to replace
Electrum's server. Stratum has multiple transports and is usable as a
blockchain server by merchants, miners and user-clients. Electrum moved
to using a Stratum implementation first relying on ABE/bitcoind and more
recently libbitcoin.</p>
<p>Stratum is unmaintained by Marek Palatinus, suffers from easy resource
starvation and denial of service attacks, and is insecure. The proposal
specified here is intended to replace the Stratum's role as a blockchain
for user-clients. The proposal here is solely concerned with removing
the onus of blockchain validation and lookups from user-clients to
specialised services in a secure manner. Any secondary benefits or uses
are purely incidental.</p>
<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>During the initial handshake between Bitcoin nodes, a version packet is
sent. version packets have a bitfield called services. Nodes can fill
this field to tell the network how they behave and which services they
support. NODE_NETWORK (1) means a node can be asked for full blocks for
example.</p>
<p>We propose two more values of NODE_SERVICE (2) and NODE_STRATIZED (4).</p>
<h3 id="NODE_SERVICE">NODE_SERVICE</h3>
<ul>
<li>A blockchain service which supports the additional messages
&quot;getoutputs&quot; and &quot;getspends&quot;.</li>
<li>Does not respond to &quot;getdata&quot; messages by itself (unless NODE_NETWORK
is specified)</li>
<li>If NODE_NETWORK is specified, then &quot;getdata&quot; for transactions will
retrieve them not only from the memory pool but also check the
blockchain if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="NODE_STRATIZED">NODE_STRATIZED</h3>
<ul>
<li>A node which uses the stratized strategy specified in this document.</li>
<li>NODE_STRATIZED will relay inventories for accepted transactions.</li>
<li>Does not support &quot;getblocks&quot; as stratized nodes do not contain the
entire blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the differences noted above, the nodes are otherwise
unchanged in their behaviour from NODE_NETWORK.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="Initialisation">Initialisation</h3>
<p>Four new messages are defined which are represented below in C-like
pseudocode.</p>
<p>&quot;getoutputs&quot;</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>struct decoded_address
</span><span>{
</span><span>    uint8_t payment_type;
</span><span>    uint8_t address_hash[16];
</span><span>};
</span><span>
</span><span>struct get_outputs
</span><span>{
</span><span>    decoded_address dest;
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p>&quot;outputs&quot;</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>struct point_t
</span><span>{
</span><span>    uint8_t hash[32];
</span><span>    uint32_t index;
</span><span>};
</span><span>
</span><span>struct outputs
</span><span>{
</span><span>    decoded_address dest;
</span><span>    uint64_t number_outputs;  // variable uint
</span><span>    point_t outpoints[];
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p>&quot;getspend&quot;</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>struct get_spend
</span><span>{
</span><span>    point_t outpoint;
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p>&quot;spend&quot;</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>struct spend
</span><span>{
</span><span>    point_t outpoint, inpoint;
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p>These four messages allow a node to discover the history of a Bitcoin
address without needing direct access to the blockchain.</p>
<p>A typical use case might look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send &quot;getoutputs&quot; for a decoded Bitcoin address.</li>
<li>Receive &quot;outputs&quot;, and loop through each contained output point:
<ol>
<li>Send &quot;getdata&quot; to download the transaction for that point.</li>
<li>Send &quot;getspend&quot; for each output point.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Receive &quot;spend&quot;:
<ol>
<li>Send &quot;getdata&quot; to download the transaction for that input point.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence allows the gradual but fast build up of history for an
address.</p>
<h3 id="Updates">Updates</h3>
<p>Nodes receive &quot;inv&quot; messages as normal from service nodes, issuing
&quot;getdata&quot; to download the block or transaction data. From this they
check for newly sent (in the input points) or received (in the output
points) payments in the transaction data.</p>
<p>Note that blocks must at minimum have their merkle root validated and
transactions must be checked for uniqueness by stratized nodes.</p>
<h2 id="Security">Security</h2>
<p>The concern here is that stratized nodes are at the mercy of blockchain
services. This proposal deals with that issue by designing this protocol
in such a way that the implementation can resolve the common history
between multiple services.</p>
<p>A stratized node will typically connect to 8 blockchain services. It
will only accept an output, spend or inventory vector that has been sent
by a common subset of all those services (6 in our example). This
spreads the risk between all services, and does not make a node
vulnerable to any one rogue blockchain service.</p>
<h2 id="Privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>The other strategy for thin clients termed <em>headers-only</em> or
<em>Simplified. Payment. Verification.</em> have the same privacy issues as
this proposal. SPV resolves this problem by sending out fake requests
for transaction data which obfuscates the client data. By sending out a
sufficient number of fake requests, privacy can be kept to a sufficient
level.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>NODE_SERVICE does not respond to &quot;getdata&quot; requests by itself (unless
used in conjunction with NODE_NETWORK) to prevent starvation attacks.
This allows a single trusted NODE_SERVICE architecture (possibly acting
as a front-end to multiple backends) to service very many nodes while
externalising the costs to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>NODE_STRATIZED tries its best to maintain the facade and help upkeep the
Bitcoin network (see relaying), but cannot support &quot;getblocks&quot; as it
does not have the entire blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="Backwards_Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>This proposal is an addon to the current Bitcoin network, and is
completely backwards compatible.</p>
