<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes a new opcode (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin
scripting system that in combination with BIP 68 allows execution
pathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output
being spent.</p>
<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY redefines the existing NOP3 opcode. When executed,
if any of the following conditions are true, the script interpreter will
terminate with an error:</p>
<ul>
<li>the stack is empty; or</li>
<li>the top item on the stack is less than 0; or</li>
<li>the top item on the stack has the disable flag (1 &lt;&lt; 31) unset; and
<ul>
<li>the transaction version is less than 2; or</li>
<li>the transaction input sequence number disable flag (1 &lt;&lt; 31) is
set; or</li>
<li>the relative lock-time type is not the same; or</li>
<li>the top stack item is greater than the transaction input sequence
(when masked according to the BIP68);</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, script execution will continue as if a NOP had been executed.</p>
<p>BIP 68 prevents a non-final transaction from being selected for
inclusion in a block until the corresponding input has reached the
specified age, as measured in block-height or block-time. By comparing
the argument to CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY against the nSequence field, we
indirectly verify a desired minimum age of the the output being spent;
until that relative age has been reached any script execution pathway
including the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will fail to validate, causing the
transaction not to be selected for inclusion in a block.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>BIP 68 repurposes the transaction nSequence field meaning by giving
sequence numbers new consensus-enforced semantics as a relative
lock-time. However, there is no way to build Bitcoin scripts to make
decisions based on this field.</p>
<p>By making the nSequence field accessible to script, it becomes possible
to construct code pathways that only become accessible some minimum time
after proof-of-publication. This enables a wide variety of applications
in phased protocols such as escrow, payment channels, or bidirectional
pegs.</p>
<h3 id="Contracts_With_Expiration_Deadlines">Contracts With Expiration Deadlines</h3>
<h4 id="Escrow_with_Timeout">Escrow with Timeout</h4>
<p>An escrow that times out automatically 30 days after being funded can be
established in the following way. Alice, Bob and Escrow create a 2-of-3
address with the following redeemscript.</p>
<p><code>   IF</code><br />
<code>       2 &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt; &lt;Bob's pubkey&gt; &lt;Escrow's pubkey&gt; 3 CHECKMULTISIG</code><br />
<code>   ELSE</code><br />
<code>       &quot;30d&quot; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>   ENDIF</code></p>
<p>At any time funds can be spent using signatures from any two of Alice,
Bob or the Escrow.</p>
<p>After 30 days Alice can sign alone.</p>
<p>The clock does not start ticking until the payment to the escrow address
confirms.</p>
<h3 id="Retroactive_Invalidation">Retroactive Invalidation</h3>
<p>In many instances, we would like to create contracts that can be revoked
in case of some future event. However, given the immutable nature of the
blockchain, it is practically impossible to retroactively invalidate a
previous commitment that has already confirmed. The only mechanism we
really have for retroactive invalidation is blockchain reorganization
which, for fundamental security reasons, is designed to be very hard and
very expensive to do.</p>
<p>Despite this limitation, we do have a way to provide something
functionally similar to retroactive invalidation while preserving
irreversibility of past commitments using CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. By
constructing scripts with multiple branches of execution where one or
more of the branches are delayed we provide a time window in which
someone can supply an invalidation condition that allows the output to
be spent, effectively invalidating the would-be delayed branch and
potentially discouraging another party from broadcasting the transaction
in the first place. If the invalidation condition does not occur before
the timeout, the delayed branch becomes spendable, honoring the original
contract.</p>
<p>Some more specific applications of this idea:</p>
<h4 id="Hash_Time-Locked_Contracts">Hash Time-Locked Contracts</h4>
<p>Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) provide a general mechanism for
off-chain contract negotiation. An execution pathway can be made to
require knowledge of a secret (a hash preimage) that can be presented
within an invalidation time window. By sharing the secret it is possible
to guarantee to the counterparty that the transaction will never be
broadcast since this would allow the counterparty to claim the output
immediately while one would have to wait for the time window to pass. If
the secret has not been shared, the counterparty will be unable to use
the instant pathway and the delayed pathway must be used instead.</p>
<h4 id="Bidirectional_Payment_Channels">Bidirectional Payment Channels</h4>
<p>Scriptable relative locktime provides a predictable amount of time to
respond in the event a counterparty broadcasts a revoked transaction:
Absolute locktime necessitates closing the channel and reopen it when
getting close to the timeout, whereas with relative locktime, the clock
starts ticking the moment the transactions confirms in a block. It also
provides a means to know exactly how long to wait (in number of blocks)
before funds can be pulled out of the channel in the event of a
noncooperative counterparty.</p>
<h4 id="Lightning_Network">Lightning Network</h4>
<p>The lightning network extends the bidirectional payment channel idea to
allow for payments to be routed over multiple bidirectional payment
channel hops.</p>
<p>These channels are based on an anchor transaction that requires a 2-of-2
multisig from Alice and Bob, and a series of revocable commitment
transactions that spend the anchor transaction. The commitment
transaction splits the funds from the anchor between Alice and Bob and
the latest commitment transaction may be published by either party at
any time, finalising the channel.</p>
<p>Ideally then, a revoked commitment transaction would never be able to be
successfully spent; and the latest commitment transaction would be able
to be spent very quickly.</p>
<p>To allow a commitment transaction to be effectively revoked, Alice and
Bob have slightly different versions of the latest commitment
transaction. In Alice's version, any outputs in the commitment
transaction that pay Alice also include a forced delay, and an
alternative branch that allows Bob to spend the output if he knows that
transaction's revocation code. In Bob's version, payments to Bob are
similarly encumbered. When Alice and Bob negotiate new balances and new
commitment transactions, they also reveal the old revocation code, thus
committing to not relaying the old transaction.</p>
<p>A simple output, paying to Alice might then look like:</p>
<p><code>   HASH160 </code><revokehash><code> EQUAL</code><br />
<code>   IF</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Bob's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ELSE</code><br />
<code>       &quot;24h&quot; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ENDIF</code><br />
<code>   CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>This allows Alice to publish the latest commitment transaction at any
time and spend the funds after 24 hours, but also ensures that if Alice
relays a revoked transaction, that Bob has 24 hours to claim the funds.</p>
<p>With CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, this would look like:</p>
<p><code>   HASH160 </code><revokehash><code> EQUAL</code><br />
<code>   IF</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Bob's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ELSE</code><br />
<code>       &quot;2015/12/15&quot; CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ENDIF</code><br />
<code>   CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>This form of transaction would mean that if the anchor is unspent on
2015/12/16, Alice can use this commitment even if it has been revoked,
simply by spending it immediately, giving no time for Bob to claim it.</p>
<p>This means that the channel has a deadline that cannot be pushed back
without hitting the blockchain; and also that funds may not be available
until the deadline is hit. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY allows you to avoid
making such a tradeoff.</p>
<p>Hashed Time-Lock Contracts (HTLCs) make this slightly more complicated,
since in principle they may pay either Alice or Bob, depending on
whether Alice discovers a secret R, or a timeout is reached, but the
same principle applies -- the branch paying Alice in Alice's commitment
transaction gets a delay, and the entire output can be claimed by the
other party if the revocation secret is known. With CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY,
a HTLC payable to Alice might look like the following in Alice's
commitment transaction:</p>
<p><code>   HASH160 DUP </code><R-HASH><code> EQUAL</code><br />
<code>   IF</code><br />
<code>       &quot;24h&quot; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code><br />
<code>       2DROP</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ELSE</code><br />
<code>       </code><Commit-Revocation-Hash><code> EQUAL</code><br />
<code>       NOTIF</code><br />
<code>           &quot;2015/10/20 10:33&quot; CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP</code><br />
<code>       ENDIF</code><br />
<code>       &lt;Bob's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>   ENDIF</code><br />
<code>   CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>and correspondingly in Bob's commitment transaction:</p>
<p><code>  HASH160 DUP </code><R-HASH><code> EQUAL</code><br />
<code>  SWAP </code><Commit-Revocation-Hash><code> EQUAL ADD</code><br />
<code>  IF</code><br />
<code>      &lt;Alice's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>  ELSE</code><br />
<code>      &quot;2015/10/20 10:33&quot; CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY</code><br />
<code>      &quot;24h&quot; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code><br />
<code>      2DROP</code><br />
<code>      &lt;Bob's pubkey&gt;</code><br />
<code>  ENDIF</code><br />
<code>  CHECKSIG</code></p>
<p>Note that both CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY are used in
the final branch of above to ensure Bob cannot spend the output until
after both the timeout is complete and Alice has had time to reveal the
revocation secret.</p>

<h4 id="2-Way_Pegged_Sidechains">2-Way Pegged Sidechains</h4>
<p>The 2-way pegged sidechain requires a new REORGPROOFVERIFY opcode, the
semantics of which are outside the scope of this BIP.
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is used to make sure that sufficient time has passed
since the return peg was posted to publish a reorg proof:</p>
<p><code>   IF</code><br />
<code>       lockTxHeight </code><lockTxHash><code> nlocktxOut [</code><workAmount><code>] reorgBounty Hash160(&lt;...&gt;) </code><genesisHash><code> REORGPROOFVERIFY</code><br />
