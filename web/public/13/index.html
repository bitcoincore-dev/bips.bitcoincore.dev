<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP describes a new type of Bitcoin address to support arbitrarily
complex transactions. Complexity in this context is defined as what
information is needed by the recipient to respend the received coins, in
contrast to needing a single ECDSA private key as in current
implementations of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In essence, an address encoded under this proposal represents the
encoded hash of a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">script</a>, rather
than the encoded hash of an ECDSA public key.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Enable &quot;end-to-end&quot; secure wallets and payments to fund escrow
transactions or other complex transactions. Enable third-party wallet
security services.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The new bitcoin address type is constructed in the same manner as
existing bitcoin addresses (see <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/Base58Check_encoding">Base58Check
encoding</a>):</p>
<p><code>   base58-encode: [one-byte version][20-byte hash][4-byte checksum]</code></p>
<p>Version byte is 5 for a main-network address, 196 for a testnet address.
The 20-byte hash is the hash of the script that will be used to redeem
the coins. And the 4-byte checksum is the first four bytes of the double
SHA256 hash of the version and hash.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>One criticism is that bitcoin addresses should be deprecated in favor of
a more user-friendly mechanism for payments, and that this will just
encourage continued use of a poorly designed mechanism.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that bitcoin addresses are inherently insecure
because there is no identity information tied to them; if you only have
a bitcoin address, how can you be certain that you're paying who or what
you think you're paying?</p>
<p>Furthermore, truncating SHA256 is not an optimal checksum; there are
much better error-detecting algorithms. If we are introducing a new form
of Bitcoin address, then perhaps a better algorithm should be used.</p>
<p>This is one piece of the simplest path to a more secure bitcoin
infrastructure. It is not intended to solve all of bitcoin's usability
or security issues, but to be an incremental improvement over what
exists today. A future BIP or BIPs should propose more user-friendly
mechanisms for making payments, or for verifying that you're sending a
payment to the Free Software Foundation and not Joe Random Hacker.</p>
<p>Assuming that typing in bitcoin addresses manually will become
increasingly rare in the future, and given that the existing checksum
method for bitcoin addresses seems to work &quot;well enough&quot; in practice and
has already been implemented multiple times, the Author believes no
change to the checksum algorithm is necessary.</p>
<p>The leading version bytes are chosen so that, after base58 encoding, the
leading character is consistent: for the main network, byte 5 becomes
the character '3'. For the testnet, byte 196 is encoded into '2'.</p>
<h2 id="Backwards_Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>This proposal is not backwards compatible, but it fails gracefully-- if
an older implementation is given one of these new bitcoin addresses, it
will report the address as invalid and will refuse to create a
transaction.</p>
