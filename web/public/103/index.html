<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP proposes a block size growth intended to accommodate for
hardware and other technological improvements for the foreseeable
future.</p>
<h2 id="Copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Many people want to see Bitcoin scale over time, allowing an increasing
number of transactions on the block chain. It would come at an increased
cost for the ecosystem (bandwidth, processing, and storage for relay
nodes, as well as an impact on propagation speed of blocks on the
network), but technology also improves over time. When all technologies
depended on have improved as well as their availability on the market,
there is no reason why Bitcoin's fundamental transaction rate cannot
improve proportionally.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a consensus rule in place that limits the size of
blocks to 1000000 bytes. Changing this requires a hard-forking change:
one that will require every full node in the network to implement the
new rules. The new chain created by those changed nodes will be rejected
by old nodes, so this would effectively be a request to the ecosystem to
migrate to a new and incompatible network. Doing this while controversy
exists is dangerous to the network and the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effective space available is always constrained by a
hash rate majority and its ability to process transactions. No hard
forking change that relaxes the block size limit can be guaranteed to
provide enough space for every possible demand - or even any particular
demand - unless strong centralization of the mining ecosystem is
expected. Because of that, the development of a fee market and the
evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space
competition should be considered healthy. This does not mean the block
size or its limitation needs to be constant forever. However, the
purpose of such a change should be evolution with technological growth,
and not kicking the can down the road because of a fear of change in
economics.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's advantage over other systems does not lie in scalability.
Well-designed centralized systems can trivially compete with Bitcoin's
on-chain transactions in terms of cost, speed, reliability, convenience,
and scale. Its power lies in transparency, lack of need for trust in
network peers, miners, and those who influence or control the system.
Wanting to increase the scale of the system is in conflict with all of
those. Attempting to buy time with a fast increase is not wanting to
face that reality, and treating the system as something whose scale
trumps all other concerns. A long term scalability plan should aim on
decreasing the need for trust required in off-chain systems, rather than
increasing the need for trust in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In summary, hard forks are extremely powerful, and we need to use them
very responsibly as a community. They have the ability to fundamentally
change the technology or economics of the system, and can be used to
disadvantage those who expected certain rules to be immutable. They
should be restricted to uncontroversial changes, or risk eroding the
expectation of low trust needed in the system in the longer term. As the
block size debate has been controversial so far - for good or bad
reasons - this BIP aims for gradual change and its effects start far
enough in the future.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The block size limitation is replaced by the function below, applied to
the median of the timestamps of the previous 11 blocks, or in code
terms: the block size limit for pindexBlock is
GetMaxBlockSize(pindexBlock-&gt;pprev-&gt;GetMedianTimePast()).</p>
<p>The sigop limit scales proportionally.</p>
<p>It implements a series of block size steps, one every ~97 days, between
January 2017 and July 2063, each increasing the maximum block size by
4.4%. This allows an overall growth of 17.7% per year.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#61676c;"><code><span>uint32_t GetMaxBlockSize(int64_t nMedianTimePast) {
</span><span>    // The first step is on January 1st 2017.
</span><span>    if (nMedianTimePast &lt; 1483246800) {
</span><span>        return 1000000;
</span><span>    }
</span><span>    // After that, one step happens every 2^23 seconds.
</span><span>    int64_t step = (nMedianTimePast - 1483246800) &gt;&gt; 23;
</span><span>    // Don&#39;t do more than 11 doublings for now.
</span><span>    step = std::min&lt;int64_t&gt;(step, 175);
</span><span>    // Every step is a 2^(1/16) factor.
</span><span>    static const uint32_t bases[16] = {
</span><span>        // bases[i] == round(1000000 * pow(2.0, (i + 1) / 16.0))
</span><span>        1044274, 1090508, 1138789, 1189207,
</span><span>        1241858, 1296840, 1354256, 1414214,
</span><span>        1476826, 1542211, 1610490, 1681793,
</span><span>        1756252, 1834008, 1915207, 2000000
</span><span>    };
</span><span>    return bases[step &amp; 15] &lt;&lt; (step / 16);
</span><span>}

<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Waiting 1.5 years before the hard fork takes place should provide ample
time to minimize the risk of a hard fork, if found uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Because every increase (including the first) is only 4.4%, risk from
large market or technological changes is minimized.</p>
<p>The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average
growth rate of bandwidth the last years, which seems to be the
bottleneck. If over time, this growth factor is beyond what the actual
technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a tighter limit.</p>
<p>Using a time-based check is very simple to implement, needs little
context, is efficient, and is trivially reviewable. Using the &quot;median
time past&quot; guarantees monotonic behaviour, as this median is required to
be increasing, according to Bitcoin's existing consensus rules. Using
the &quot;median time past&quot; of the block before means we know in advance what
the limit of each block will be, without depending on the actual block's
timestamp.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old
fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread
consensus.</p>
