<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies a proposed change to the semantics of the
'version' field in Bitcoin blocks, allowing multiple backward-compatible
changes (further called &quot;soft forks&quot;) to be deployed in parallel. It
relies on interpreting the version field as a bit vector, where each bit
can be used to track an independent change. These are tallied each
retarget period. Once the consensus change succeeds or times out, there
is a &quot;fallow&quot; pause after which the bit can be reused for later changes.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="/34">BIP 34</a> introduced a mechanism for doing
soft-forking changes without a predefined flag timestamp (or flag block
height), instead relying on measuring miner support indicated by a
higher version number in block headers. As it relies on comparing
version numbers as integers however, it only supports one single change
being rolled out at once, requiring coordination between proposals, and
does not allow for permanent rejection: as long as one soft fork is not
fully rolled out, no future one can be scheduled.</p>
<p>In addition, BIP 34 made the integer comparison (nVersion &gt;= 2) a
consensus rule after its 95% threshold was reached, removing
2<sup>31</sup>+2 values from the set of valid version numbers (all
negative numbers, as nVersion is interpreted as a signed integer, as
well as 0 and 1). This indicates another downside this approach: every
upgrade permanently restricts the set of allowed nVersion field values.
This approach was later reused in <a href="/66">BIP
66</a> and <a href="/65">BIP
65</a>, which further removed nVersions 2
and 3 as valid options. As will be shown further, this is unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>Each soft fork deployment is specified by the following per-chain
parameters (further elaborated below):</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>name</strong> specifies a very brief description of the soft fork,
reasonable for use as an identifier. For deployments described in a
single BIP, it is recommended to use the name &quot;bipN&quot; where N is the
appropriate BIP number.</li>
<li>The <strong>bit</strong> determines which bit in the nVersion field of the block
is to be used to signal the soft fork lock-in and activation. It is
chosen from the set {0,1,2,...,28}.</li>
<li>The <strong>starttime</strong> specifies a minimum median time past of a block at
which the bit gains its meaning.</li>
<li>The <strong>timeout</strong> specifies a time at which the deployment is
considered failed. If the median time past of a block &gt;= timeout
and the soft fork has not yet locked in (including this block's bit
state), the deployment is considered failed on all descendants of
the block.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Selection_guidelines">Selection guidelines</h3>
<p>The following guidelines are suggested for selecting these parameters
for a soft fork:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>name</strong> should be selected such that no two softforks, concurrent
or otherwise, ever use the same name.</li>
<li><strong>bit</strong> should be selected such that no two concurrent softforks use
the same bit.</li>
<li><strong>starttime</strong> should be set to some date in the future,
approximately one month after a software release date including the
soft fork. This allows for some release delays, while preventing
triggers as a result of parties running pre-release software.</li>
<li><strong>timeout</strong> should be 1 year (31536000 seconds) after starttime.</li>
</ol>
<p>A later deployment using the same bit is possible as long as the
starttime is after the previous one's timeout or activation, but it is
discouraged until necessary, and even then recommended to have a pause
in between to detect buggy software.</p>
<h3 id="States">States</h3>
<p>With each block and soft fork, we associate a deployment state. The
possible states are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DEFINED</strong> is the first state that each soft fork starts out as.
The genesis block is by definition in this state for each
deployment.</li>
<li><strong>STARTED</strong> for blocks past the starttime.</li>
<li><strong>LOCKED_IN</strong> for one retarget period after the first retarget
period with STARTED blocks of which at least threshold have the
associated bit set in nVersion.</li>
<li><strong>ACTIVE</strong> for all blocks after the LOCKED_IN retarget period.</li>
<li><strong>FAILED</strong> for one retarget period past the timeout time, if
LOCKED_IN was not reached.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Bit_flags">Bit flags</h3>
<p>The nVersion block header field is to be interpreted as a 32-bit
little-endian integer (as present), and bits are selected within this
integer as values (1 &lt;&lt; N) where N is the bit number.</p>
<p>Blocks in the STARTED state get an nVersion whose bit position bit is
set to 1. The top 3 bits of such blocks must be 001, so the range of
actually possible nVersion values is [0x20000000...0x3FFFFFFF],
inclusive.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints set by BIP 34, BIP 66 and BIP 65, we only have
0x7FFFFFFB possible nVersion values available. This restricts us to at
most 30 independent deployments. By restricting the top 3 bits to 001 we
get 29 out of those for the purposes of this proposal, and support two
future upgrades for different mechanisms (top bits 010 and 011). When a
block nVersion does not have top bits 001, it is treated as if all bits
are 0 for the purposes of deployments.</p>
<p>Miners should continue setting the bit in LOCKED_IN phase so uptake is
visible, though this has no effect on consensus rules.</p>
<h3 id="New_consensus_rules">New consensus rules</h3>
<p>The new consensus rules for each soft fork are enforced for each block
that has ACTIVE state.</p>
<h3 id="State_transitions">State transitions</h3>
<p><img src="bip-0009/states.png" align="middle"></img></p>
<p>The genesis block has state DEFINED for each deployment, by definition.</p>
<p><code>   State GetStateForBlock(block) {</code><br />
<code>       if (block.height == 0) {</code><br />
<code>           return DEFINED;</code><br />
<code>       }</code></p>
<p>All blocks within a retarget period have the same state. This means that
if floor(block1.height / 2016) = floor(block2.height / 2016), they are
guaranteed to have the same state for every deployment.</p>
<p><code>       if ((block.height % 2016) != 0) {</code><br />
<code>           return GetStateForBlock(block.parent);</code><br />
<code>       }</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, the next state depends on the previous state:</p>
<p><code>       switch (GetStateForBlock(GetAncestorAtHeight(block, block.height - 2016))) {</code></p>
<p>We remain in the initial state until either we pass the start time or
the timeout. GetMedianTimePast in the code below refers to the median
nTime of a block and its 10 predecessors. The expression
GetMedianTimePast(block.parent) is referred to as MTP in the diagram
above, and is treated as a monotonic clock defined by the chain.</p>
<p><code>       case DEFINED:</code><br />
<code>           if (GetMedianTimePast(block.parent) &gt;= timeout) {</code><br />
<code>               return FAILED;</code><br />
<code>           }</code><br />
<code>           if (GetMedianTimePast(block.parent) &gt;= starttime) {</code><br />
<code>               return STARTED;</code><br />
<code>           }</code><br />
<code>           return DEFINED;</code></p>
<p>After a period in the STARTED state, if we're past the timeout, we
switch to FAILED. If not, we tally the bits set, and transition to
LOCKED_IN if a sufficient number of blocks in the past period set the
deployment bit in their version numbers. The threshold is ≥1916 blocks
(95% of 2016), or ≥1512 for testnet (75% of 2016). The transition to
FAILED takes precedence, as otherwise an ambiguity can arise. There
could be two non-overlapping deployments on the same bit, where the
first one transitions to LOCKED_IN while the other one simultaneously
transitions to STARTED, which would mean both would demand setting the
bit.</p>
<p>Note that a block's state never depends on its own nVersion; only on
that of its ancestors.</p>
<p><code>       case STARTED: </code><br />
<code>           if (GetMedianTimePast(block.parent) &gt;= timeout) {</code><br />
<code>               return FAILED;</code><br />
<code>           }</code><br />
<code>           int count = 0;</code><br />
<code>           walk = block;</code><br />
<code>           for (i = 0; i &lt; 2016; i++) {</code><br />
<code>               walk = walk.parent;</code><br />
<code>               if (walk.nVersion &amp; 0xE0000000 == 0x20000000 &amp;&amp; (walk.nVersion &gt;&gt; bit) &amp; 1 == 1) {</code><br />
<code>                   count++;</code><br />
<code>               }</code><br />
<code>           }</code><br />
<code>           if (count &gt;= threshold) {</code><br />
<code>               return LOCKED_IN;</code><br />
<code>           }</code><br />
<code>           return STARTED;</code></p>
<p>After a retarget period of LOCKED_IN, we automatically transition to
ACTIVE.</p>
<p><code>       case LOCKED_IN:</code><br />
<code>           return ACTIVE;</code></p>
<p>And ACTIVE and FAILED are terminal states, which a deployment stays in
once they're reached.</p>
<p><code>       case ACTIVE:</code><br />
<code>           return ACTIVE;</code></p>
<p><code>       case FAILED:</code><br />
<code>           return FAILED;</code><br />
<code>       }</code><br />
<code>   }</code></p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong> It should be noted that the states are maintained
along block chain branches, but may need recomputation when a
reorganization happens.</p>
<p>Given that the state for a specific block/deployment combination is
completely determined by its ancestry before the current retarget period
(i.e. up to and including its ancestor with height block.height - 1 -
(block.height % 2016)), it is possible to implement the mechanism above
efficiently and safely by caching the resulting state of every
multiple-of-2016 block, indexed by its parent.</p>
<h3 id="Warning_mechanism">Warning mechanism</h3>
<p>To support upgrade warnings, an extra &quot;unknown upgrade&quot; is tracked,
using the &quot;implicit bit&quot; mask = (block.nVersion &amp; ~expectedVersion) !=
0. Mask will be non-zero whenever an unexpected bit is set in nVersion.
Whenever LOCKED_IN for the unknown upgrade is detected, the software
should warn loudly about the upcoming soft fork. It should warn even
more loudly after the next retarget period (when the unknown upgrade is
in the ACTIVE state).</p>
<h3 id="getblocktemplate_changes">getblocktemplate changes</h3>
<p>The template request Object is extended to include a new item:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>template request</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Key</td></tr>
<tr><td>rules</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The template Object is also extended:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>template</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Key</td></tr>
<tr><td>rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>vbavailable</td></tr>
<tr><td>vbrequired</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The &quot;version&quot; key of the template is retained, and used to indicate the
server's preference of deployments. If versionbits is being used,
&quot;version&quot; MUST be within the versionbits range of
[0x20000000...0x3FFFFFFF]. Miners MAY clear or set bits in the block
version WITHOUT any special &quot;mutable&quot; key, provided they are listed
among the template's &quot;vbavailable&quot; and (when clearing is desired) NOT
included as a bit in &quot;vbrequired&quot;.</p>
<p>Softfork deployment names listed in &quot;rules&quot; or as keys in &quot;vbavailable&quot;
may be prefixed by a '!' character. Without this prefix, GBT clients may
assume the rule will not impact usage of the template as-is; typical
examples of this would be when previously valid transactions cease to be
valid, such as BIPs <a href="/16">16</a>,
<a href="/65">65</a>,
<a href="/66">66</a>,
<a href="/68">68</a>,
<a href="/112">112</a>, and
<a href="/113">113</a>. If a client does not understand a
rule without the prefix, it may use it unmodified for mining. On the
other hand, when this prefix is used, it indicates a more subtle change
to the block structure or generation transaction; examples of this would
be <a href="/34">BIP 34</a> (because it modifies coinbase
construction) and <a href="/141">141</a> (since it
modifies the txid hashing and adds a commitment to the generation
transaction). A client that does not understand a rule prefixed by '!'
must not attempt to process the template, and must not attempt to use it
for mining even unmodified.</p>
<h2 id="Support_for_future_changes">Support for future changes</h2>
<p>The mechanism described above is very generic, and variations are
possible for future soft forks. Here are some ideas that can be taken
into account.</p>
<p><strong>Modified thresholds</strong> The 1916 threshold (based on BIP 34's 95%) does
not have to be maintained for eternity, but changes should take the
effect on the warning system into account. In particular, having a
lock-in threshold that is incompatible with the one used for the warning
system may have long-term effects, as the warning system cannot rely on
a permanently detectable condition anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting soft forks</strong> At some point, two mutually exclusive soft
forks may be proposed. The naive way to deal with this is to never
create software that implements both, but that is making a bet that at
least one side is guaranteed to lose. Better would be to encode &quot;soft
fork X cannot be locked-in&quot; as consensus rule for the conflicting soft
fork - allowing software that supports both, but can never trigger
conflicting changes.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-stage soft forks</strong> Soft forks right now are typically treated as
booleans: they go from an inactive to an active state in blocks. Perhaps
at some point there is demand for a change that has a larger number of
stages, with additional validation rules that get enabled one by one.
The above mechanism can be adapted to support this, by interpreting a
combination of bits as an integer, rather than as isolated bits. The
warning system is compatible with this, as (nVersion &amp;
~nExpectedVersion) will always be non-zero for increasing integers.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The failure timeout allows eventual reuse of bits even if a soft fork
was never activated, so it's clear that the new use of the bit refers to
a new BIP. It's deliberately very coarse-grained, to take into account
reasonable development and deployment delays. There are unlikely to be
enough failed proposals to cause a bit shortage.</p>
<p>The fallow period at the conclusion of a soft fork attempt allows some
detection of buggy clients, and allows time for warnings and software
upgrades for successful soft forks.</p>
