<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Add a new message, &quot;feefilter&quot;, which serves to instruct peers not to
send &quot;inv&quot;'s to the node for transactions with fees below the specified
fee rate.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The concept of a limited mempool was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.12 to
provide protection against attacks or spam transactions of low fees that
are not being mined. A reject filter was also introduced to help prevent
repeated requests for the same transaction that might have been recently
rejected for insufficient fee. These methods help keep resource
utilization on a node from getting out of control.</p>
<p>However, there are limitations to the effectiveness of these approaches.
The reject filter is reset after every block which means transactions
that are inv'ed over a longer time period will be rerequested and there
is no method to prevent requesting the transaction the first time.
Furthermore, inv data is sent at least once either to or from each peer
for every transaction accepted to the mempool and there is no mechanism
by which to know that an inv sent to a given peer would not result in a
getdata request because it represents a transaction with too little fee.</p>
<p>After receiving a feefilter message, a node can know before sending an
inv that a given transaction's fee rate is below the minimum currently
required by a given peer, and therefore the node can skip relaying an
inv for that transaction to that peer.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<ol>
<li>The feefilter message is defined as a message containing an int64_t
where pchCommand == &quot;feefilter&quot;</li>
<li>Upon receipt of a &quot;feefilter&quot; message, the node will be permitted,
but not required, to filter transaction invs for transactions that
fall below the feerate provided in the feefilter message interpreted
as satoshis per kilobyte.</li>
<li>The fee filter is additive with a bloom filter for transactions so
if an SPV client were to load a bloom filter and send a feefilter
message, transactions would only be relayed if they passed both
filters.</li>
<li>Inv's generated from a mempool message are also subject to a fee
filter if it exists.</li>
<li>Feature discovery is enabled by checking protocol version &gt;= 70013</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>The propagation efficiency of transactions across the network should not
be adversely affected by this change. In general, transactions which are
not accepted to a node's mempool are not relayed by this node and the
functionality implemented with this message is meant only to filter
those transactions. There could be a small number of edge cases where a
node's mempool min fee is actually less than the filter value a peer is
aware of and transactions with fee rates between these values will now
be newly inhibited.</p>
<p>Feefilter messages are not sent to whitelisted peers if the
&quot;-whitelistforcerelay&quot; option is set. In that case, transactions are
intended to be relayed even if they are not accepted to the mempool.</p>
<p>There are privacy concerns with deanonymizing a node by the fact that it
is broadcasting identifying information about its mempool min fee. To
help ameliorate this concern, the implementation quantizes the filter
value broadcast with a small amount of randomness, in addition, the
messages are broadcast to different peers at individually randomly
distributed times.</p>
<p>If a node is using prioritisetransaction to accept transactions whose
actual fee rates might fall below the node's mempool min fee, it may
want to consider disabling the fee filter to make sure it is exposed to
all possible txid's.</p>
<h2 id="Backward_compatibility">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>Older clients remain fully compatible and interoperable after this
change. Also, clients implementing this BIP can choose to not send any
feefilter messages.</p>
