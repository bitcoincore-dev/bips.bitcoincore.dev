<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP alters the Payment Protocol to allow for zero value OP_RETURN
outputs in serialized PaymentRequests.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The Payment Protocol (defined in BIP70) gives merchants a way to build
sophisticated transactions by serializing one or more outputs in the
form of a PaymentRequest. The PaymentRequest is then served over
http/https to a customer's wallet where the serialized transaction can
be executed.</p>
<p>While the Payment Protocol allows for any valid script in its outputs,
it also ignores outputs with zero value. This means BIP70
implementations can encode an OP_RETURN script but must provide a
greater than dust value for that output. The end result is a successful
PaymentRequest transaction with an OP_RETURN but the value assigned to
that output is lost forever.</p>
<p>This BIP allows for zero value OP_RETURN outputs in serialized
PaymentRequests. The change means that OP_RETURN scripts will work as
they were originally intended from within PaymentRequests without
permanently destroying Bitcoin value. Zero value non-OP_RETURN scripts
should continue to be ignored.</p>
<p>In addition to fixing the issue of destroyed value, this change opens up
new use cases that were previously impossible.</p>
<p>While storing data on the blockchain is controversial, when used
responsibly OP_RETURN provides a powerful mechanism for attaching
metadata to a transaction. This BIP effectively decouples the creation
of transactions containing OP_RETURN data from the execution of those
transactions. The result are positive benefits for both merchants and
wallets/customers.</p>
<p>By supporting this BIP, wallets can participate in current and future,
unforeseen use cases that benefit from metadata stored in OP_RETURN.
Until now OP_RETURN transactions have typically been created and
submitted by custom software. If a wallet can process a PaymentRequest
with OP_RETURN data as proposed by this BIP, it will support potentially
sophisticated Bitcoin applications without the wallet developer having
to have prior knowledge of that application.</p>
<p>An example might be a merchant that adds the hash of a plain text
invoice to the checkout transaction. The merchant could construct the
PaymentRequest with the invoice hash in an OP_RETURN and pass it to the
customer's wallet. The wallet could then submit the transaction,
including the invoice hash from the PaymentRequest. The wallet will have
encoded a proof of purchase to the blockchain without the wallet
developer having to coordinate with the merchant software or add
features beyond this BIP.</p>
<p>Merchants and Bitcoin application developers benefit from this BIP
because they can now construct transactions that include OP_RETURN data
in a keyless environment. Again, prior to this BIP, transactions that
used OP_RETURN (with zero value) needed to be constructed and executed
in the same software. By separating the two concerns, this BIP allows
merchant software to create transactions with OP_RETURN metadata on a
server without storing public or private Bitcoin keys. This greatly
enhances security where OP_RETURN applications currently need access to
a private key to sign transactions.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The specification for this BIP is straightforward. BIP70 should be fully
implemented with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outputs where the script is an OP_RETURN and the value is zero should
be accepted by the wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>BIP70 has special handling for the case with multiple zero value
outputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the sum of outputs.amount is zero, the customer will be asked how
much to pay, and the bitcoin client may choose any or all of the
Outputs (if there are more than one) for payment. If the sum of
outputs.amount is non-zero, then the customer will be asked to pay the
sum, and the payment shall be split among the Outputs with non-zero
amounts (if there are more than one; Outputs with zero amounts shall
be ignored).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This behavior should be retained with the exception of OP_RETURN
handling. In the case of a multiple output transaction where the sum of
the output values is zero, the user should be prompted for a value and
that value should be distributed over any or all outputs <em>except</em> the
OP_RETURN output. In the case where the sum of outputs.amount is
non-zero then any OP_RETURN outputs should not be ignored but no value
should be assigned to them.</p>
<p>Payment requests also must contain at least one payable output (i.e. no
payment requests with <em>just</em> an OP_RETURN).</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>As with the discussion around vanilla OP_RETURN, the practice of storing
data on the blockchain is controversial. While blockchain and network
bloat is an undeniable issue, the benefits that come from attaching
metadata to transactions has proven to be too powerful to dismiss
entirely. In the absence of OP_RETURN support the Bitcoin ecosystem has
seen alternative, less elegant and more wasteful methods employed for
Blockchain data storage.</p>
<p>As it exists today, BIP70 allows for OP_RETURN data storage at the
expense of permanently destroyed Bitcoin. Even fully removing support
for OP_RETURN values in the Payment Protocol would still leave the door
open to suboptimal data encoding via burning a larger than dust value to
an output with a false address designed to encode data.</p>
<p>This BIP offers all of the same benefits that come from the OP_RETURN
compromise. Mainly that OP_RETURN scripts are provably unspendable and
thus can be pruned from the UTXO pool. Without supporting this BIP,
wallets that support BIP70 will allow for wasteful data storage.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>Since this BIP still supports OP_RETURN statements with a greater than
zero value, it should be fully backwards compatible with any existing
implementations.</p>
