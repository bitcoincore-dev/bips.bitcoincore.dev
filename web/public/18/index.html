<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This BIP modifies the basic format of transaction inputs and outputs,
replacing the current scriptSig and scriptPubKey (scripts executed to
validate a transaction) with new contents: dataSig, scriptCheck, and
hashScriptCheck.</p>
<h2 id="Copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>This BIP is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The purpose of pay-to-script-hash is to move the responsibility for
supplying the conditions to redeem a transaction from the sender of the
funds to the redeemer.</p>
<p>The benefit is allowing a sender to fund any arbitrary transaction, no
matter how complicated, using a fixed-length 20-byte hash that is short
enough to scan from a QR code or easily copied and pasted.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>scriptSig and scriptPubKey are hereby deemed to be deprecated.
Bitcoin-compatible clients MUST still continue to support them for
compatibility, but it should not be used for any new transaction types.
Services and people which send Bitcoins SHOULD continue to support old
pubkey-based addresses for the time being. Services and people which
receive Bitcoins MAY continue to generate and use old pubkey-based
addresses.</p>
<p>To replace these, there are 3 new elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>dataSig is included in place of scriptSig in transaction inputs, and
contains multiple serialized data elements</li>
<li>scriptCheck is the final element of dataSig, and is executed with the
preceding dataSig elements preloaded onto the stack (the element
immediately before scriptCheck is the top of the stack)</li>
<li>hashScriptCheck is included in place of scriptPubKey in transaction
outputs, to specify the hash of the scriptCheck allowed to redeem it</li>
</ul>
<p>dataSig is to be encoded the same as a push-only script.</p>
<p>hashScriptCheck must be encoded exactly so:</p>
<p><code>   0xa9 0x14 (20-byte-hash-value) 0x87</code></p>
<p>This can be interpreted by legacy (pre-BIP 18) clients as the following
script:</p>
<p><code>   OP_HASH160 [20-byte-hash-value] OP_EQUAL</code></p>
<p>If this template is not matched exactly OR the transaction is in a block
with a timestamp before the hashScriptCheck activation date, validation
MUST proceed in backward-compatibility mode, using
scriptSig+scriptPubKey rather than dataSig+scriptCheck+hashScriptCheck.</p>
<p>A hashScriptCheck-compliant input is valid only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>dataSig MUST NOT contain any operations other than &quot;push data&quot; (it is
data, not a script; no mixing scriptSig with hashScriptCheck)</li>
<li>scriptCheck MUST hash (using Bitcoin's Hash160 algorithm) to the
output's hashScriptCheck.</li>
<li>scriptCheck MUST be executed with the dataSig-based stack specified
above (ie, not including scriptCheck itself) to perform validation
(this does not imply clients are required to validate transactions).</li>
<li>scriptCheck must not abort, and must leave a true value on the top of
the stack. This is the current behaviour for scriptSig+scriptPubKey.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new scriptCheck SHOULD be checked against &quot;standard transaction&quot;
templates by miners.</p>
<p>For example, the hashScriptCheck and corresponding dataSig for a
one-signature-required transaction is:</p>
<p><code>   scriptCheck: [pubkey] OP_CHECKSIG</code><br />
<code>   dataSig: [signature] {[pubkey] OP_CHECKSIG}</code><br />
<code>   hashScriptCheck: [20-byte-hash of {[pubkey] OP_CHECKSIG}]</code></p>
<h3 id="Signature_operation_limits_for_scriptCheck">Signature operation limits for scriptCheck</h3>
<p>Signature operations in scriptCheck do not follow the same rules
previously applied to scriptSig and scriptPubKey. Instead, they shall
contribute to the maximum number allowed per block (20,000) as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>OP_CHECKSIG and OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY count as 1 signature operation,
whether or not they are evaluated.</li>
<li>OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY immediately preceded by
OP_1 through OP_16 are counted as 1 to 16 signature operation,
whether or not they are evaluated.</li>
<li>All other OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY are counted as
20 signature operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>+3 signature operations:</p>
<p><code>   2 [pubkey1] [pubkey2] [pubkey3] 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code></p>
<p>+22 signature operations</p>
<p><code>   OP_CHECKSIG OP_IF OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY OP_ELSE OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY OP_ENDIF</code></p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>This BIP replaces BIPs 12 and 17, which propose extensions to the Script
system to allow scriptPubKey to outsource its verification. It also
replaces BIP 16, which is identical in terms of protocol, but suggests a
specific implementation and does not deprecate scriptPubKey to maintain
protocol consistency.</p>
<p>The Motivation for this BIP (and BIP 13, the pay-to-script-hash address
type) is somewhat controversial; several people feel that it is
unnecessary, and complex/multisignature transaction types should be
supported by simply giving the sender the complete {serialized script}.
The author believes that this BIP will minimize the changes needed to
all of the supporting infrastructure that has already been created to
send funds to a base58-encoded-20-byte bitcoin addresses, allowing
merchants and exchanges and other software to start supporting
multisignature transactions sooner.</p>
<p>The signature operation counting rules are intended to be easy and quick
to implement by statically scanning scriptCheck. Bitcoin imposes a
maximum-number-of-signature-operations per block to prevent
denial-of-service attacks on miners. If there was no limit, a rogue
miner might broadcast a block that required hundreds of thousands of
ECDSA signature operations to validate, and it might be able to get a
head start computing the next block while the rest of the network worked
to validate the current one.</p>
<p>There is a 1-confirmation attack on old implementations, but it is
expensive and difficult in practice. The attack is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker creates a pay-to-script-hash transaction that is valid when
interpreted as scriptPubKey, but contains an invalid scriptCheck,
and sends themselves some coins using it.</li>
<li>Attacker also creates a standard transaction that spends the
pay-to-script transaction, and pays the victim who is running old
software.</li>
<li>Attacker mines a block that contains both transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the victim accepts the 1-confirmation payment, then the attacker wins
because both transactions will be invalidated when the rest of the
network overwrites the attacker's invalid block.</p>
<p>The attack is expensive because it requires the attacker create a block
that they know will be invalidated by the rest of the network. It is
difficult because creating blocks is difficult and users should not
accept 1-confirmation transactions for higher-value transactions.</p>
<h2 id="Backwards_Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>hashScriptCheck transactions are non-standard to old implementations,
which will (typically) not relay them nor include them in blocks.</p>
<p>Old implementations will validate that scriptCheck's hash value matches
when they validate blocks created by software that fully support this
BIP, but will do no other validation.</p>
<p>Avoiding a block-chain split by malicious pay-to-script transactions
requires careful handling of one case:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pay-to-script-hash transaction that is invalid for new
clients/miners but valid for old clients/miners.</li>
</ul>
<p>To gracefully upgrade and ensure no long-lasting block-chain split
occurs, more than 50% of miners must support full validation of the new
transaction type and must switch from the old validation rules to the
new rules at the same time.</p>
<p>To judge whether or not more than 50% of hashing power supports this
BIP, miners are asked to upgrade their software and put the string
&quot;/P2SH/&quot; in the input of the coinbase transaction for blocks that they
create.</p>
<p>At 00:00:00 UTC on 15 Mar 2012, the block-chain will be examined to
determine the number of blocks supporting pay-to-script-hash for the
previous 7 days. If 550 or more contain &quot;/P2SH/&quot; in their coinbase, then
all blocks with timestamps after 00:00:00 UTC on 1 Apr 2012 shall have
their pay-to-script-hash transactions fully validated. Approximately
1,000 blocks are created in a week; 550 should, therefore, be
approximately 55% of the network supporting the new feature.</p>
<p>If a majority of hashing power does not support the new validation
rules, then rollout will be postponed (or rejected if it becomes clear
that a majority will never be achieved).</p>
<h2 id="Forwards_Compatibility">Forwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>The first two bytes of hashScriptCheck specify the hash algorithm and
length used to verify scriptCheck. This BIP only allows Bitcoin's
Hash160 algorithm, but leaves open the possibility of a future BIP
implementing others.</p>
