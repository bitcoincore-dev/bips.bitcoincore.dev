<h2 id="Simple_Summary">Simple Summary</h2>
<p>Bitcoin's energy consumption is growing with its value (see Figure
below). Although scaling PoW is necessary to maintain the security of
the network, reliance on massive energy consumption has scaling
drawbacks and leads to mining centralization. A major consequence of the
central role of local electricity cost in mining is that today, most
existing and potential participants in the Bitcoin network cannot
profitably mine Bitcoin even if they have the capital to invest in
mining hardware. From a practical perspective, Bitcoin adoption by
companies like Tesla (which recently rescinded its acceptance of Bitcoin
as payment) has been hampered by its massive energy consumption and
perceived environmental impact.</p>

<p>We propose a novel proof-of-work paradigm for Bitcoin--Optical
proof-of-work. It is designed to decouple Bitcoin mining from energy and
make it feasible outside of regions with low electricity costs. <em>Optical
proof-of-work</em> (oPoW) is a modification of Hashcash that is most
efficiently computed using a new class of photonic processors. Without
compromising the cryptographic or game-theoretical security of Hashcash,
oPoW shifts the operating expenses of mining (OPEX), to capital expenses
(CAPEX)--i.e. electricity to hardware. oPoW makes it possible for
billions of new miners to enter the market simply by investing in a
low-energy photonic miner. Shifting to a high-CAPEX PoW has the added
benefit of making the hashrate resilient to Bitcoin's price
fluctuations - once low-OPEX hardware is operating there is no reason to
shut it down even if the value of mining rewards diminishes. oPoW is
hardware-compatible with GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs meaning that a
transitional period of optical and traditional hardware mining in
parallel on the network is feasible</p>

<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin gained utility and value over the preceding decade, the
network incentivized the purchase of billions of dollars in mining
equipment and electricity. With the growth of competition, home mining
became unprofitable. Even the most sophisticated special-purpose
hardware (ASIC miners) doesn’t cover its energy costs unless the miner
also has direct access to very cheap electricity. This heavy reliance on
energy makes it difficult for new miners to enter the market and leads
to hashrate instability as miners shut off their machines when the price
of Bitcoin falls. Additionally as the network stores ever more value,
the percentage of world energy consumption that is associated with
Bitcoin continues to grow, creating the potential for scaling failure
and a general backlash. To ensure that Bitcoin can continue scaling and
reach its full potential as a world currency and store of value, we
propose a low-energy proof-of-work paradigm for Bitcoin. <em>Optical proof
of work (oPoW)</em> is designed to decouple Bitcoin’s security from massive
energy use and make bitcoin mining feasible outside of regions with low
electricity costs. <em>Optical proof-of-work</em> is a modification of Hashcash
that is most efficiently computed using a new class of photonic
processors that has emerged as a leading solution for ultra-low energy
computing over the last 5 years. oPoW shifts the operating expenses of
mining (OPEX), to capital expenses (CAPEX)–i.e. electricity to hardware,
without compromising the cryptographic or game-theoretical security of
Hashcash. We provide an example implementation of oPoW, briefly discuss
its cryptographic construction as well as the working principle of
photonic processors. Additionally, we outline the potential benefits of
oPoW to the bitcoin network, including geographic decentralization and
democratization of mining as well as hashrate resilience to price
fluctuations.</p>

<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin has grown over the past decade from a small network run by
hobbyists to a global currency, the underlying Proof of Work protocol
has not been updated. Initially pitched as a global decentralized
network (“one CPU-one vote”), Bitcoin transactions today are secured by
a small group of corporate entities. In practice, it is only feasible
for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://archive.is/YeDwh">entities that can secure access to abundant, inexpensive
energy</a>. The economics of mining limit
profitability to places like Iceland, Texas, or Western China. Besides
the negative environmental externalities, which may be significant,
mining today is performed primarily with the consent (and in many cases,
partnership) of large public utilities and the governments that control
them. Although this may not be a problem in the short term, in the long
term it stands to erode the censorship resistance and security of
Bitcoin and other public blockchains through potential regulation or
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07524.pdf">partitioning attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Recent events, such as the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MustafaYilham/status/1384278267067203590">~25% hashrate crash due to coal-powered
grid failure in
china</a> and
Tesla’s rescinding of its acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment,
show that there are practical real-world downsides to Proof of Works’s
massive reliance on energy.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0052/emusk_tweet.png"></img></p>
<p>Whether or not the Bitcoin community accepts this common criticism as
entirely valid, it has real-world effects which will only get worse over
time. Eliminating the exponentially growing energy use currently built
into Bitcoin without eliminating the security of PoW would be ideal and
should not be a partisan issue.</p>
<p>New consensus mechanisms have been proposed as a means of securing
cryptocurrencies whilst reducing energy cost, such as various forms of
Proof of Stake and Proof of Space-Time. While many of these alternative
mechanisms offer compelling guarantees, they generally require new
security assumptions, which have not been stress-tested by live
deployments at any adequate scale. Consequently, we still have
relatively little empirical understanding of their safety. Completely
changing the Bitcoin paradigm is likely to introduce new unforeseen
problems. We believe that the major issues discussed above can be
resolved by improving rather than eliminating Bitcoin’s fundamental
security layer—Proof of Work. Instead of devising a new consensus
architecture to fix these issues, it is sufficient to shift the
economics of PoW. The financial cost imposed on miners need not be
primarily composed of electricity. The situation can be significantly
improved by reducing the operating expense (OPEX)—energy—as a major
mining component. Then, by shifting the cost towards capital expense
(CAPEX)—mining hardware—the dynamics of the mining ecosystem becomes
much less dependent on electricity prices, and much less electricity is
consumed as a whole.</p>
<p>Moreover, a reduction in energy consumption automatically leads to
geographically distributed mining, as mining becomes profitable even in
regions with expensive electricity. Additionally, lower energy
consumption will eliminate heating issues experienced by today’s mining
operations, which will further decrease operating cost as well as noise
associated with fans and cooling systems. All of this means that
individuals and smaller entities would be able to enter the mining
ecosystem simply for the cost of a miner, without first gaining access
to cheap energy or a dedicated, temperature-controlled data center. To a
degree, memory-hard PoW schemes like <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo">Cuckoo
Cycle</a>, which increase the use of SRAM
in lieu of pure computation, push the CAPEX/OPEX ratio in the right
direction by occupying ASIC chip area with memory. To maximize the CAPEX
to OPEX ratio of the Optical Proof of Work algorithm, we developed
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://assets.pubpub.org/xi9h9rps/01581688887859.pdf"><em>HeavyHash</em></a>
[1]. HeavyHash is a cryptographic construction that takes the place of
SHA256 in Hashcash. Our algorithm is hardware-compatible with
ultra-energy-efficient photonic co-processors that have been developed
for machine learning hardware accelerators.</p>
<p>HeavyHash uses a proven digital hash (SHA3) packaged with a large amount
of MAC (Multiply-and-Accumulate) computation into a Proof of Work
puzzle. Although HeavyHash can be computed on any standard digital
hardware, it becomes hardware efficient only when a small digital core
is combined with a low-power photonic co-processor for performing MAC
operations. oPoW mining machines will have a small digital core
flip-chipped onto a large, low-power photonic chip. This core will be
bottlenecked by the throughput of the digital to analog and analog to
digital converters. A prototype of such analogue optical matrix
multiplier can be seen in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="bip-0052/optical_chip.png"></img></p>

telecom wavelength) B. Metal pads for controlling modulators to

terminus of each waveguide. E. Alignment circuit for aligning fiber
coupling stage. Bottom: a photograph of a bare oPoW miner prototype chip
before wire and fiber bonding. On the right side of the die are test
structures (F).</p>
<p>The <em>HeavyHash</em> derives its name from the fact that it is bloated or
weighted with additional computation. This means that a cost comparable
oPoW miner will have a much lower nominal hashrate compared to a Bitcoin
ASIC (HeavyHashes/second vs. SHA256 Hashes/second in equivalent ASIC).
We provide the cryptographic security argument of the HeavyHash function
in Section 3 in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://assets.pubpub.org/xi9h9rps/01581688887859.pdf">Towards Optical Proof of
Work</a> [1]. In
the article, we also provide a game-theoretic security argument for
CAPEX-heavy PoW. For additional information, we recommend reading <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://uncommoncore.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/A-model-for-Bitcoins-security-and-the-declining-block-subsidy-v1.02.pdf">this

<p>While traditional digital hardware relies on electrical currents,
optical computing uses light as the basis for some of or all of its
operations. Building on the development and commercialization of silicon
photonic chips for telecom and datacom applications, modern photonic
co-processors are silicon chips made using well-established and highly
scalable silicon CMOS processes. However, unlike cutting edge
electronics which require ever-smaller features (e.g. 5 nm), fabricated
by exponentially more complex and expensive machinery, silicon photonics
uses old fabrication nodes (90 nm). Due to the large de Broglie
wavelength of photons, as compared to electrons, there is no benefit to
using the small feature sizes. The result is that access to silicon
photonic wafer fabrication is readily available, in contrast to the
notoriously difficult process of accessing advanced nodes. Moreover, the
overall cost of entry is lower as lithography masks for silicon
photonics processes are an order of magnitude cheaper ($500k vs. $5M).

<h3 id="Geographic_Distribution_of_Mining_Relative_to_CAPEX-OPEX_Ratio_of_Mining_Costs">Geographic Distribution of Mining Relative to CAPEX-OPEX Ratio of Mining Costs</h3>
<p>Below is a simple model showing several scenarios for the geographic
distribution of mining activity relative to the CAPEX/OPEX ratio of the
cost of operating a single piece of mining hardware. As the ratio of
energy consumption to hardware cost decreases, geographic variations in
energy cost cease to be a determining factor in miner distribution.</p>
<p>Underlying assumptions: 1. Electricity price y is fixed in time but
varies geographically. 2. Every miner has access to the same hardware.
3. Each miner’s budget is limited by both the cost of mining equipment
as well as the local cost of the electricity they consume</p>
<p>budget = a(p+ey),</p>
<p>where a is the number of mining machines, p is the machine price, e is
the total energy consumption over machine lifetime, and y is electricity
price.</p>
<p>Note that in locations where mining is not profitable, hashrate is zero.</p>

<h3 id="Why_does_CAPEX_to_OPEX_shift_lead_to_lower_energy_consumption?">Why does CAPEX to OPEX shift lead to lower energy consumption?</h3>
<p>A common misconception about oPoW is that it makes mining “cheaper” by
enabling energy-efficient hardware. There is no impact on the dollar
cost of mining a block, rather the mix of energy vs. hardware investment
changes from about 50/50 to 10/90 or better. We discuss this at length
and rigorously in our paper[1].</p>
<h3 id="Working_Principles_of_Photonic_Processors">Working Principles of Photonic Processors</h3>
<p>Photonics accelerators are made by fabricating waveguides in silicon
using standard lithography processes. Silicon is transparent to infrared
light and can act as a tiny on-chip fiber optical cable. Silicon
photonics found its first use during the 2000s in transceivers for
sending and receiving optical signals via fiber and has advanced
tremendously over the last decade.</p>
<p>By encoding a vector into optical intensities passing through a series
of parallel waveguides, interfering these signals in a mesh of tunable
interferometers (acting as matrix coefficients), and then detecting the
output using on-chip Germanium photodetectors, a matrix-vector
multiplication is achieved. A generalized discussion of matrix
multiplication setups using photonics/interference can be found in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.58">Reck
et al.</a>
and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06220">Russell et al.</a> A detailed
discussion of several integrated photonic architectures for matrix
multiplication and corresponding tuning algorithms can be found in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06179.pdf">Pai
et al.</a></p>
<p>Below is a conceptual representation of a 3D-packaged oPoW mining chip.
Note that the majority of the real estate and cost comes from the
photonic die and the laser, with only a small digital SHA3 die needed
(as opposed to a conventional miner of the same cost, which would have
many copies of this die running in parallel).</p>
<p><img src="bip-0052/optminer.png"></img></p>
<h3 id="Block_Reward_Considerations">Block Reward Considerations</h3>
<p>Although it is out of the scope of this proposal, the authors strongly
recommend the consideration of a change in the block reward schedule
currently implemented in Bitcoin. There is no clear way to incentivize
miners with transaction fees only, as has been successfully shown in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/CKWN-CCS16.pdf">On
the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block
Reward</a> and other
publications, therefore looking a decade or two ahead it will be
important to implement a fixed block reward or to slow the decay of the
block reward to maintain the security of the network. Given that oPoW
miners have low operating costs, once a large number of machines are
running the reward level sufficient to keep them in operation and
providing robust security can potentially be significantly smaller than
in the case of the current SHA256 ASICs securing Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="Implementation_on_the_Bitcoin_Network">Implementation on the Bitcoin Network</h3>
<p>A hard fork is not necessarily required for the Bitcoin network to test
and eventually implement oPoW. It’s possible to add oPoW as a dual PoW
to Bitcoin as a soft fork. Tuning the parameters to ensure that, for
example, 99.9% of the security budget would be earned by miners via the
SHA256 Hashcash PoW and 0.1% via oPoW would create sufficient incentive
for oPoW to be stress-tested and to incentivize the manufacture of
dedicated oPoW miners. If this test is successful, the parameters can be
tuned continuously over time, e.g. oPoW share doubling at every halving,
such that oPoW accounts for some target percentage (up to 100% in a
complete SHA256 phase-out).</p>
<h4 id="Reverse_compatibility">Reverse compatibility</h4>
<p>Our understanding is that oPoW will not be reverse compatible.</p>
<h3 id="ASICBOOST">ASICBOOST</h3>
<p>Any new PoW algorithm carries the risk of hardware developers
discovering and patenting an architecture with a significant speedup, as
happened in the case of ASICBOOST for SHA256. HeavyHash is comprised of
an SHA hash and 4-bit linear matrix-vector operations. The intent is for
the matrix-vector multiplications to account for the majority of the
work involved in computing a single HeavyHash operation. As we show in
the Minimum Effective Hardness section of Towards Optical Proof of
Work[1], there is no workaround to performing the matrix operations
when computing HeavyHash, and since the SHA hashes are negligible, a
true ASICBOOST-type speed up would require a speed up in linear matrix
processing. Since matrix-vector multiplication is at the heart of neural
networks and many other common computational workloads, it has been
optimized very heavily and is generally very well understood. The
acceleration of matrix-vector multiplication hardware (e.g. photonic
coprocessors, memristors, etc.) is a very general problem and there are
dozens of companies working on it, making it very unlikely for a single
party to corner the market.</p>

<p>With significant progress in optical and analog
matrix-vector-multiplication chipsets over the last year, we hope to
demonstrate commercial low-energy mining on our network in the next 6
months. The current generation of optical matrix processors under
development is expected to have 10x better energy consumption per MAC
operation than digital implementations, and we expect this to improve by
another order of magnitude in future generations.</p>
<p>PoWx will also be publishing the designs of the current optical miner
prototypes in the near term under an open-source hardware license.</p>

<p>We thank all the members of the Bitcoin community who have already given
us feedback over the last several years as well as others in the optical
computing community and beyond that have given their input.</p>
