<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies a BIP8 (LOT=true) deployment to activate
taproot.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The Taproot soft fork upgrade has been assessed to have overwhelming
community consensus and hence should attempt to be activated. Lessons
have been learned from the BIP148 and BIP91 deployments in 2017 with
regards to giving many months of advance warning before the mandatory
signaling is attempted. The mandatory signaling is only required if
miners have failed to meet the signaling threshold during the BIP8
deployment. It is important that mandatory signaling is included as
without it miners would effectively have the ability to indefinitely
block the activation of a soft fork with overwhelming consensus.</p>
<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
<p>This BIP will begin an activation signaling period using bit 2 at
blockheight 681408 with a minimum activation height of 709632 and an
activation threshold of 90%. The signaling period will timeout at
blockheight 760032 with a latest activation height of 762048.
Lockinontimeout (LOT) is set to true so mandatory signaling will be
enforced in the last signaling period before the timeout height. Blocks
without the signaling bit 2 set run the risk of being rejected during
this period if taproot is not locked in prior. This BIP will cease to be
active when taproot is locked in.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Backward_Compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h2>
<p>As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without
modification. Non-upgraded nodes, however, will consider all SegWit
version 1 witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts. They are
strongly encouraged to upgrade in order to fully validate the new
programs.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility_with_later_alternative_activations">Compatibility with later alternative activations</h2>
<p>The activation mechanism “Speedy Trial” as proposed by Russell O’Connor
and outlined in this bitcoin-dev mailing list
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html">post</a>
by David Harding was released in Bitcoin Core. It is effectively a BIP8
activation mechanism with one exception: start height and timeout height
were defined using median time past (MTP) rather than block heights. It
uses signaling bit 2, was deployed between midnight April 24th 2021 and
midnight August 11th 2021, has a minimum activation height of 709632 and
intends to activate BIPs 340, 341, and 342. The BIP8(LOT=true)
deployment is compatible with the “Speedy Trial” deployment in Bitcoin
Core as there was not a discrepancy between MTP and block height for the
defined start heights.</p>
<p>The BIP8 (LOT=true) deployment has also been deliberately designed to be
compatible with a future BIP8(LOT=false) or BIP8(LOT=true) deployment in
Bitcoin Core assuming Bitcoin Core releases one of these activation
mechanisms in the event of the Speedy Trial deployment failing to
activate.</p>
<h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The deployment of BIP148 demonstrated that multiple implementations with
different activation mechanisms can incentivize the necessary actors to
act so that the different deployments activate in sync. A BIP8 LOT=true
deployment can run in parallel with other BIP8 activation mechanisms
that have eventual mandatory signaling or no mandatory signaling.
Eventual mandatory signaling ensures that miners cannot prevent the
activation of a desired feature with community consensus indefinitely.</p>
